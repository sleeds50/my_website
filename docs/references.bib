However, another critical layer—intergroup relations—frames many decisions about how resources and support should be allocated. Based on theories of self and social identity uncertainty, subjective group dynamics, leadership, and social cohesion, we argue that this intergroup layer has important implications for people’s perceptions of their own and others’ situation, political management of the pandemic, how people are influenced, and how they resolve identity uncertainty. In the face of the pandemic, initial national or global unity is prone to intergroup fractures and competition through which leaders can exploit uncertainties to gain short-term credibility, power, or influence for their own groups, feeding polarization and extremism. Thus, the social and psychological challenge is how to sustain the superordinate objective of surviving and recovering from the pandemic through mutual cross-group effort.},

  abstract = {Despite years of research and practice, dissatisfaction with performance appraisal is at an all-time high. Organizations are contemplating changes to their performance management systems, the most controversial of which is whether to eliminate performance ratings. The pros and cons of retaining performance ratings were the subject of a lively, standing-room-only debate at the 2015 Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology conference in Philadelphia (Adler, 2015). Given the high interest in this topic, this article recaps the points made by the panelists who participated in the debate. The arguments for eliminating ratings include these: (a) the disappointing interventions, (b) the disagreement when multiple raters evaluate the same performance, (c) the failure to develop adequate criteria for evaluating ratings, (d) the weak relationship between the performance of ratees and the ratings they receive, (e) the conflicting purposes of performance ratings in organizations, (f) the inconsistent effects of performance feedback on subsequent performance, and (g) the weak relationship between performance rating research and practice in organizations. The arguments for retaining ratings include (a) the recognition that changing the rating process is likely to have minimal effect on the performance management process as a whole, (b) performance is always evaluated in some manner, (c) “too hard” is no excuse for industrial–organizational (I-O) psychology, (d) ratings and differentiated evaluations have many merits for improving organizations, (e) artificial tradeoffs are driving organizations to inappropriately abandon ratings, (f) the alternatives to ratings may be worse, and (g) the better questions are these: How could performance ratings be improved, and are we conducting the entire performance management process properly? The article closes with questions organizational members have found useful for driving effective performance management reform.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to synthesize a body of research addressing changes in academic identity brought on by neo-liberal university management while proposing a new interpretation based on the institutional work theory and a relational approach to agency. Design/methodology/approach The authors analyzed 19 qualitative empirical studies regarding the impact of new public management policies on academic identity within universities from different countries to support a qualitative meta-synthesis. Findings The meta-synthesis established a classification of work identity and self-identity that reflects variable but globally difficult experiences with the universities’ neo-liberal management. The results also indicate that, paradoxically, academics contribute to the perpetuation of managerialism through protection strategies and institutional maintenance work while acknowledging their painful effects on their identity. Despite the control and monitoring measures put in place by university administrations, academics have assumed a pragmatic approach to identity by using the prevailing spaces of autonomy and engaging in constant self-questioning. Those involved could make better use of these free spaces by adopting projective agency, that is by expanding the areas of support, collaboration and creativity that, by their own admission, make up the academic profession. Originality/value This meta-synthesis sheds light on the limits of current academic identity research while advancing studies conducted on institutional work, primarily by highlighting the type of agency used by actors during institutional change; at a practical level, this research promotes discussion on the manner in which academics could use their agency and reflexive skills by pushing their institutional work surrounding identity recreation further.},

  abstract = {Purpose – Worker well‐being continues to be fundamental to the study of work and a primary consideration for how organizations can achieve competitive advantage and sustainable and ethical work practices (Cartwright and Holmes; Harter, Schmidt and Keyes; Wright and Cropanzano). The science and practice of employee engagement, a key indicator of employee well‐being, continues to evolve with ongoing incremental refinements to existing models and measures. This study aims to elaborate the Job Demands‐Resources model of work engagement (Bakker and Demerouti) by examining how organizational, team and job level factors interrelate to influence engagement and well‐being and downstream outcome variables such as affective commitment and extra‐role behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – Structural equations modelling of survey data obtained from 3,437 employees of a large multi‐national mining company was used to test the important direct and indirect influence of organizational focused resources (a culture of fairness and support), team focused resources (team climate) and job level resources (career development, autonomy, supervisor support, and role clarity) on employee well‐being, engagement, extra‐role behaviour and organizational commitment. Findings – The fit of the proposed measurement and structural models met criterion levels and the structural model accounted for sizable proportions of the variance in engagement/wellbeing (66 percent), extra‐role‐behaviour (52 percent) and commitment (69 percent). Research limitations/implications – Study limitations (e.g. cross‐sectional research design) and future opportunities are outlined. Originality/value – The study demonstrates important extensions to the Job Demands‐Resources model and provides researchers and practitioners with a simple but powerful motivational framework, a suite of measures, and a map of their inter‐relationships which can be used to help understand, develop and manage employee well‐being and engagement and their outcomes.},

Strengths typically showed small but significant positive associations with age, with the strongest associations with age between curiosity and love of learning (strengths of wisdom and knowledge), fairness (a strength of justice), and forgiveness and self-regulation (strengths of temperance). The discussion addresses potential limitations and suggests pertinent directions for future research.},

The authors review the rapidly growing body of research in this area with particular attention to the period 2002 to 2013, inclusive.

We note that research into creativity has typically examined the stage of idea generation, whereas innovation studies have commonly also included the latter phase of idea implementation. The authors discuss several seminal theories of creativity and innovation and then apply a comprehensive levels-of-analysis framework to review extant research into individual, team, organizational, and multilevel innovation. Key measurement characteristics of the reviewed studies are then noted. In conclusion, we propose a guiding framework for future research comprising 11 major themes and 60 specific questions for future studies.},

This question has long captivated philosophers, scholars, and laypeople alike, and yet prior empirical findings have been inconclusive. In the current research, we conducted two preregistered prospective longitudinal studies in which we measured participants’ disagreeableness prior to entering the labor market and then assessed the power they attained in the context of their work organization ∼14 y later when their professional careers had unfolded. Both studies found disagreeable individuals did not attain higher power as opposed to extraverted individuals who did gain higher power in their organizations. Furthermore, the null relationship between disagreeableness and power was not moderated by individual differences, such as gender or ethnicity, or by contextual variables, such as organizational culture. What can account for this null relationship? A close examination of behavior patterns in the workplace found that disagreeable individuals engaged in two distinct patterns of behavior that offset each other’s effects on power attainment: They engaged in more dominant-aggressive behavior, which positively predicted attaining higher power, but also engaged in less communal and generous behavior, which predicted attaining less power. These two effects, when combined, appeared to cancel each other out and led to a null correlation between disagreeableness and power.},

  abstract = {The toll of workplace bullying is immense, yet, similarly as with an iceberg, its scope, scale and implications tend to remain underestimated. Several ways of assessing the prevalence of workplace bullying have been proposed in the literature. The most frequently discussed are the ‘subjective method’ assessing individuals’ perceptions of being a victim and the questionnaire, i.e., criterion-based, methods, including Negative Acts Questionnaire (NAQ) and Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror (LIPT). Since in both cases culture plays a profound role as a mediating factor in the process of identifying, collecting, and processing data, the applicability of these methods across cultures and countries has several limitations. At this stage, it is impossible to determine the impact of the implicit cultural-bias that these methods entail on the research outcomes. This would be possible if an alternative workplace bullying scale (WBS) was at hand and, consequently, a comparative analysis was conducted. This paper, drawing from a study conducted at higher education institutions (HEI) across Pakistan, addresses this issue by devising an alternative WBS. The value added of this paper is three-fold, i.e., it elaborates on the study and the specific methods employed to prove the validity and relevance of the alternative WBS. Moreover, by so doing, it addresses some of the limitations that other methods measuring the prevalence of workplace bullying display. As a result, it adds to the researchers’ and administrators’ toolkit as regards research and policies aimed at mitigating the scope and scale of bullying at HEIs across cultures and countries.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at enquiring into different interpersonal psychological factors and their interrelationships, such that the influence they possess at workplace on behaviours of knowledge sharing can be described. Knowledge based industries were referred to extract a sample consisting of 450 employees. In order to collect the information about knowledge sharing performance, Big Five personality, Emotional intelligence and work engagement, tools such as viz. Knowledge Sharing Behavior (KSB) scale by Yi (2009)56, Big Five personality traits scale by Gosling et al. (2003)21, Workgroup Emotional Intelligence Profile (WEIP-S) by Jordan \& Lawrence (2009)26 and Utrecht Work Engagement Scale by Schaufeli et al. (2003)46 were utilized. Partial Least Square technique of Structural Equation Modeling was applied using Smart PLS 2.0.M3, in order to recognize the proposed meaning of intended relationships. Researches, that sought to interpret behaviors of knowledge sharing at workplace (Here 0.5246 significant at p{$<$}0.01 is calculated as the Total Effect of conscientiousness on knowledge sharing), points out at the prominence of conscientiousness amongst Big Five personality traits. Between Big Five traits, except agreeableness, and knowledge sharing, emotional intelligence establishes itself as the main mediator of relationship. Even though work engagement is a significant predictor of knowledge sharing (Here 0.1698, significant at p{$<$}0.01 is calculated as Total Effect of work engagement on knowledge sharing), its role as a negotiator is minimal. This paper might have some limitations but the primary concern is that it is the first study that considers propinquity of personality, emotional intelligence, work engagement and knowledge sharing while simultaneously tries to assess and comprehend the mediating role of emotional intelligence and work engagement in outlining and describing knowledge sharing, all in a single study.},

  abstract = {In this position paper, I argue that the main purpose of research is to discover and report on phenomena in a truthful manner. Once uncovered, these phenomena can have important implications for society. The utility of research depends on whether it makes a contribution because it is original or can add to cumulative research efforts, is rigorously and reliably done, and is able to inform basic or applied research and later policy. However, five serious “diseases” stifle the production of useful research. These diseases include: significosis, an inordinate focus on statistically significant results; neophilia, an excessive appreciation for novelty; theorrhea, a mania for new theory; arigorium, a deficiency of rigor in theoretical and empirical work; and finally, disjunctivitis, a proclivity to produce large quantities of redundant, trivial, and incoherent works. I surmise that these diseases have caused immense harm to science and have cast doubt on the role of science in society. I discuss what publication gatekeepers should do to eradicate these diseases, to stimulate the undertaking of more useful and impactful research, and to provide the needed incentives to better align the interests of researchers with those of the greater good. Finally, I highlight where technical improvements are needed to enhance research quality, and call on deeper reflection, transparency, and honesty in how we do research.},

To deal with this unprecedented challenge, I discuss the importance of leadership, particularly charismatic leadership, which is well suited to solving problems in situations of ambiguity and crisis. I also exhort researchers to pay more attention to studying leadership using robust and causally identified designs that can inform policy.},

The use and perception of time is one of the specific cultural values that differ cross-culturally and may have implications for the group dynamics and team effectiveness in multinational teams. Concepts such as time orientation, punctuality and pace of life are influenced by time-related differences among cultures. In the present article, it is argued that temporal diversity in multinational teams may serve as an input within the Input-Mediator-Output-Input model of team effectiveness (Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, \& Jundt, 2005) and influence the team processes and outputs. Implications of cross-cultural differences in perception of time on multinational team functioning are discussed within the framework of the Marks, Mathieu, and Zaccaro (2001) taxonomy of team processes, which consists of 3 higher order team processes (i.e., transition processes, action processes, and interpersonal processes) that encompass 10 distinct, more specific processes. Propositions regarding the impact of temporal diversity on many of the distinct team processes and outcomes are put forward to help provide a temporal lens to future research on multinational teams.},

We tested whether SAB and age GI fluctuate over time, whether they influence attributions of negative daily work events as age-related, and thereby predict older workers’ daily affect and cognitive engagement in their work. A diary study with 169 older workers (aged 50–70 years) demonstrates that there are substantial daily variations in SAB and GI. Daily fluctuations of SAB and age GI respectively predicted attributions of negative personal (e.g., forgetfulness) and social (e.g., social exclusion) work events to age. Age attributions, in turn, negatively predicted affect and daily cognitive engagement over and above event occurrence. In other words, when confronted with negative daily work events, the short-term dissociation from one’s chronological age and age group (i.e., feeling younger and identifying less with other older adults) seems to benefit older workers’ well-being.

We define normalizing as institutionalized processes by which extraordinary situations are rendered seemingly ordinary. Four means of normalizing are discussed: (1) diffusing, where undesired emotions are dissipated or their impact is reduced; (2) reframing, where emotions or the situation are recast such that the emotions are forestalled, redefined, or rendered more acceptable; (3) adaptation, where repeated exposure to a situation reduces its emotional impact; and (4) ritualism, where the enactment of standardized procedures provides a sense of control and a momentum of means, thereby reducing emotions. We conclude that because normalizing often has a strong “as if” or pretend quality—requiring ongoing and mutual face-work, often supported by symbolic management—it is an inherently fragile practice that is easier to sustain in groups than as individuals.},

Few empirical studies, however, have examined how individual or situational factors relate to engagement. Consequently, this study examines the interplay between employee age, perceived coworker age composition, and satisfaction with older (older than 55) and younger (younger than 40) coworkers on engagement using a sample of 901 individuals employed in the United Kingdom. Results indicated that satisfaction with one's coworkers related significantly to engagement. Moreover, perceived age similarity was associated with higher levels of engagement among older workers when they were highly satisfied with their coworkers over 55 and lower levels of engagement when they were not.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the narrative of an institution’s official history, the autobiography, as compared to the biography constructed by researchers. Design/methodology/approach A case study was conducted on the Organization of Latin American Immigrants in Israel (OLEI), covering the entire history of the organization. Based on a longitudinal, holistic and qualitative perspective, the research methodology combines data collected from interviews, archival and digital sources. The access to these data enables researchers to explore some of the reasons and circumstance behind the construction of the official history. Findings The analysis of the data revealed a significant gap between the autobiography and the biography in four episodes. The common thread running through them was the creation of a narrative that reinforces and emphasizes the growth and stability of the organization, through the use of strategies such as forgetting, erasing and remythologizing. This narrative was found to have been re-constructed following a period of instability. Originality/value The originality of this study relies on the use of the terminology of autobiography and biography for the exploration of the official history of an organization. The innovative research methodology applied in this paper, which compares an organization’s biography with its autobiography, enables the exploration of different dimensions and dynamics, emphasizing the value of understanding autobiography by constructing a biography.},

To bring coherence to the diffuse body of literature on engagement, the authors conducted a systematic synthesis of narrative evidence involving 214 studies focused on the meaning, antecedents and outcomes of engagement. The authors identified six distinct conceptualizations of engagement, with the field dominated by the Utrecht Group's ‘work engagement’ construct and measure, and by the theorization of engagement within the ‘job demands–resources’ framework. Five groups of factors served as antecedents to engagement: psychological states; job design; leadership; organizational and team factors; and organizational interventions. Engagement was found to be positively associated with individual morale, task performance, extra-role performance and organizational performance, and the evidence was most robust in relation to task performance. However, there was an over-reliance on quantitative, cross-sectional and self-report studies within the field, which limited claims of causality. To address controversies over the commonly used measures and concepts in the field and gaps in the evidence-base, the authors set out an agenda for future research that integrates emerging critical sociological perspectives on engagement with the psychological perspectives that currently dominate the field.},

On the basis of the literature on proactive personality and the job demands?resources model, we hypothesized that employees with a proactive personality would be most likely to craft their own jobs, in order to stay engaged and perform well. Data were collected among 95 dyads of employees (N = 190), who were working in various organizations. The results of structural equation modeling analyses offered strong support for the proposed model. Employees who were characterized by a proactive personality were most likely to craft their jobs (increase their structural and social job resources, and increase their job challenges); job crafting, in turn, was predictive of work engagement (vigor, dedication, and absorption) and colleague-ratings of in-role performance. These findings suggest that, to the extent that employees proactively adjust their work environment, they manage to stay engaged and perform well.},

On the basis of theory on individualization of career trajectories, it was expected that the possibility for employees to customize their careers would be positively related to their job attitudes and subsequent objective career success, as indicated by their levels of affective commitment, work engagement, and received salary and bonuses. However, these effects were expected to occur primarily under the combination of high manager support for implementation of career customization and, on the basis of lifespan theory, older workers, as customization fulfills their increased heterogeneous career preferences. A three‐wave longitudinal study largely showed support for the study hypotheses; the relation between MCC use and work engagement and subsequent career success was stronger for older workers who received support for MCC, whereas the relation between MCC use and commitment was negative for older workers who received low support. The study shows the benefits of career customization in organizations by showing the conditions under which these benefits will manifest.

The existing research examining the effects of training design, trainee, and work-environment factors on conditions of transfer is reviewed and critiqued. Research gaps identified from the review include the need to (1) test various operationalizations of training design and work-environment factors that have been posited as having an impact on transfer and (2) develop a framework for conducting research on the effects of trainee characteristics on transfer.

Yet despite recent demands for evidence-based practice, too little of the science of transfer is informing professionals in their design and execution of training initiatives. We offer three broad prescriptions for moving future transfer research toward more consumer-centric outcomes: (1) systematically report more and richer information related to the trainees, trainers, and organizational contexts under study; (2) focus explicitly on the optimization of transfer - not just learning; and (3) expand the measurement and reporting of transfer outcomes. We conclude with a general call for transfer scholars to adopt a more consumer-centric mind-set where studies are designed with an eye to informing training interventions of greatest frequency and importance to contemporary organizations and training practitioners.},

  abstract = {Relationships between leaders' motivation and their use of charismatic, transactional, and / or transformational leadership were examined in this study. One hundred eighty-six leaders and 759 direct reports from a variety of organizations were sampled. Leaders were administered the Motivation Sources Inventory (MSI) while followers reported leaders' full range leadership behaviors using the Multi-factor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-rater version). Leaders were also administered the self-rating version of the Multi-factor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-rater version). The Motivation Sources Inventory subscales subsequently significantly correlated with leader self-reports of inspirational motivation, idealized influence (behavior) and individualized consideration (range, r = .10 to .29), as well as with raters' perceptions of inspirational motivation, idealized influence (behavior) and individualized consideration (range, r = .18 to .19). The Motivation Sources Inventory subscales significantly correlated with leaders' self-reports of charisma, transactional and laissez-faire leadership (range, r = .12 to .28), with rater-reports of the same variables (range, r = .16 to .29).

The rationale is described and contrasted with previous mechanisms for controlling standards in test use. The overall strategy is to develop more competent test users and to provide better information for them about tests. The latter is being accomplished through the establishment of a Register of Test Users with its associated journal Selection and Development Review; and the publication by BPS Books of regular test reviews and updates. To date, a Certification process has been implemented relating to psychological test use in occupational assessment settings. This comprises qualifications at two levels: 'Level A' (tests of ability and aptitude) and 'Level B' (personality assessment). The design and implementation of this system has raised many problems--theoretical, practical, political, and commercial. The focus of the new approach represents a radical change from past practice. It emphasises the competence of test users--rather than the means by which competence is attained. Standards have been defined and mechanisms established for assessing competence and for verifying and monitoring the quality of the assessment process.

We examine this relationship using data from 89 clinical managers at the United Kingdom National Health Service who implemented change projects between 2003 and 2004. Our results lend overall support to the proposed theory. This finding suggests that treating planned organizational change as a generic phenomenon might mask important idiosyncrasies associated both with the different activities involved in the change implementation process and with the unique functions that leadership competencies might play in the execution of these activities.},

It outlines a definition of workplace bullying, key debates and prescriptions suggested in previously published literature for management to contest and prevent it. When bullying is perceived in terms of managerial control of labour and the core concepts of the labour process – an approach not previously embraced in the established psychological and social psychological analyses of the issue – bullying is better understood as an endemic feature of the capitalist employment relationship. Existing secondary material and future research possibilities are then explored and discussed, with some conclusions that are aimed to take the research in this field in new directions.},

We find that managers thought the costs of these programs to be higher than the benefits. Alternative managerial practices such as effective leadership, clear objectives, coaching, or training were thought a better investment. Despite the undisputed instrumentality of pay-for-performance to motivate, little attention has been given to whether the benefits outweigh the costs or the “fit” of these programs with high-commitment cultures like Hewlett-Packard was at the time. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In a randomized control-group experiment with nurses working at a local health authority in Italy, performance-related pay (PRP) had a larger effect on task performance when the rewards were kept secret than when they were disclosed. The negative interaction between PRP and visibility was stronger among participants who were exposed to direct contact with a beneficiary of their efforts, which heightened their perception of making a positive difference in other people's lives. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions that monetary incentives for activities with a prosocial impact may crowd out employee image motivation.

Reasons related in part to best practice in human resource management: pay structures were designed to attract and retain executives with the potential of large earnings; to focus their efforts in the direction agreed by the board; and to demonstrate fairness. Importantly, the variable pay was seen as a symbol of the director’s success, both internally and to his or her peers in other companies. Finally, and significantly, an institutional theory explanation was given: companies used performancerelated pay because their peers did, and because that legitimised them in the eyes of the establishment.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities opened up by those messy, unclear and indeterminate data in research situations that may be described as being in the shadow and may as such remain in a state of vagueness and indeterminacy. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on the extant literature on shadow organizing and post-qualitative methodologies. It focuses attention on not-yet (or shadow data) in order to ponder over what researchers do to data when they are not (yet) black-boxed as such. At the same time, it investigates what it is that not-yet data do to researchers. Findings Four types of “not-yet” data – illegible, wondrous and disorienting, hesitant and worn out – are presented and discussed. Data are illegible when a researcher is in the position of not knowing how to interpret what is in front of her/him. A second illustration is constructed around wonder, and poses the question of the feelings of surprise and disorientation that arise when facing uncanny realities. In a third situation, not-yet data are narrated as hesitation, when a participant feels conflicting desires and the researchers hesitates in interpreting. The fourth illustration depicts not-yet data as data that have been corrupted, that vanish after time or are worn out. Practical implications Not-yet data belong to researchers practice but can also be found in other professional practices which are concerned with the indeterminacy of shadowy situations. It is argued that situations like these constitute opportunities for learning and for the moral and professional development, so long as indeterminacy is kept open and a process of “slowing down” both action and interpretation is nurtured. Originality/value This paper is of value for taking the metaphor of shadow organizing further. Moreover, it represents a rare attempt to bring the vast debate on post-qualitative research/methodologies into management studies, which with very few exceptions seems to have been ignored by organization studies.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of individual, environmental, training design, and affective reaction factors on training transfer and transfer motivation. To determine the relationship between these factors and their influence on training transfer and to test the model, the researchers collected data from employees in the Malaysian banking sector. Structural equation modeling with Amos 16 was used to test the model and determine the relationship. The study suggested that training stakeholders should manage the training program effectively. Transfer is maximized when trainees have social support, high performance self-efficacy, and transfer motivation. Stakeholders (e.g., trainers, trainees, supervisors, and peers) are important to the training transfer process, as are learner readiness, trainee reaction, instrumentality, and training retention. This study revealed that perceived content validity and transfer design work together and influence the trainee's performance self-efficacy. In other words, if trainers want to improve the performance self-efficacy level of trainees, they need to explain how the trainee can transfer the learned skills at the workplace and make sure the content of the training is similar to the actual job. The main objective of training programs is to align the employee's expertise with organizational goals. Organizations can achieve their desired objectives only when employees transfer the learned skills on the job. Unfortunately, employees often transfer only a small percentage of skills they have learned in training. To effectively manage their training programs, organizations need to identify and focus on the factors that resist effective training transfer.},

Organizations are comprised of people who communicate and socially construct artifacts, norms, values, and assumptions that guide how they conduct business. That is, employees interact to create, maintain, and reify their organizational culture. One artifact of organisational culture that should be apparent to human performance technologists is the environmental design of the office in which the organization operates. While some performance improvement interventions focus on the orientation of humans to their physical surroundings (ie., ergonomics), our analysis focuses on the communication patterns and organizational culture imbedded in the physical environment. We posit that performance technologists should look beyond the explicit environment and analyze organizational culture to begin understanding the implicit nature of how employees perform. A case study is provided to illustrate how three levels of organizational culture can be used to analyze an environment in which employees work to determine appropriate performance improvement solutions.},

Our established theories of group processes and intergroup relations can help us understand these new ways of working and online group experiences. However, there are key differences in computer-mediated and face-to-face (FtF) groups. In this essay, I present some of the extant robust theories and findings from computer communication research to understand virtual working within online groups. These perspectives include that group processes develop over a longer period of time as compared to FtF, informal communication is neglected, computer-mediated groups have some advantages over FtF groups, sociomateriality is a useful theoretical lens, and dispersion affects group member cognitions about each other. I use my own lab’s work on entitativity as an example of how moving from FtF to online group research can deepen our understanding of both FtF and online groups. The essay concludes with recommendations for future research.},

This article presents a meta-analysis of 89 empirical studies that explore the impact of predictive factors (e.g., trainee characteristics, work environment, training interventions) on the transfer of training to different tasks and contexts. We also examine moderator effects of the relationships between these predictors and transfer. Results confirmed positive relationships between transfer and predictors such as cognitive ability, conscientiousness, motivation, and a supportive work environment. Several moderators had significant effects on transfer relationships, including the nature of the training objectives. Specifically, most predictor variables examined (e.g., motivation, work environment) had stronger relationships to transfer when the focus of training was on open (e.g., leadership development) as opposed to closed (e.g., computer software) skills. Other moderators related to the measurement of transfer also influenced transfer relationships, including situations in which transfer outcomes were obtained by the same source in the same measurement context— which consistently inflated transfer relationships. Findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for future research and training practice.},

  abstract = {Shift work comprises work schedules that extend beyond the typical “nine-to-five” workday, wherein schedules often comprise early work start, compressed work weeks with 12-hour shifts, and night work. According to recent American and European surveys, between 15 and 30\% of adult workers are engaged in some type of shift work, with 19\% of the European population reportedly working at least 2hours between 22:00 and 05:00. The 2005 International Classification of Sleep Disorders estimates that a shift work sleep disorder can be found in 2–5\% of workers. This disorder is characterized by excessive sleepiness and/or sleep disruption for at least one month in relation with the atypical work schedule. Individual tolerance to shift work remains a complex problem that is affected by the number of consecutive work hours and shifts, the rest periods, and the predictability of work schedules. Sleepiness usually occurs during night shifts and is maximal at the end of the night. Impaired vigilance and performance occur around times of increased sleepiness and can seriously compromise workers’ health and safety. Indeed, workers suffering from a shift work sleep-wake disorder can fall asleep involuntarily at work or while driving back home after a night shift. Working on atypical shifts has important socioeconomic impacts as it leads to an increased risk of accidents, workers’ impairment and danger to public safety, especially at night. The aim of the present review is to review the circadian and sleep-wake disturbances associated with shift work as well as their medical impacts. Résumé Le travail posté exige des périodes de travail qui sortent du cadre conventionnel des journées “de neuf à cinq”. Les horaires de travail comportent souvent un début de travail précoce, des horaires comprimés avec quarts de 12heures ainsi que des périodes de travail de nuit. Des enquêtes récentes américaine et européenne rapportent qu’entre 15 et 30~\% des travailleurs adultes travaillent sur un horaire non conventionnel, incluant 19~\% de la population européenne qui rapporte travailler au moins 2heures entre 22:00 et 05:00. La classification internationale des troubles de sommeil de 2005 estime qu’un désordre de sommeil lié au travail posté peut être observé chez 2–5~\% des travailleurs. Ce désordre se caractérise par de la somnolence excessive et/ou des perturbations du sommeil pendant au moins un mois en relation avec l’horaire atypique de travail. La tolérance d’un individu au travail posté demeure un problème complexe qui dépend du nombre d’heures et de quarts consécutifs de travail, des périodes de repos et de l’aspect prévisible de l’horaire de travail. La somnolence survient généralement la nuit et est maximale en fin de nuit. Les perturbations de vigilance et de performance surviennent lors des périodes de somnolence accrue et peuvent compromettre sérieusement la santé et sécurité des travailleurs. En effet, les travailleurs souffrant du désordre de sommeil lié au travail posté peuvent s’endormir involontairement au travail et en conduisant lors du retour à domicile après un quart de nuit. Le travail posté a d’importantes implications socioéconomiques en raison du risque accru d’accidents, de l’altération des capacités des travailleurs et des dangers de sécurité publique qu’il comporte, en particulier la nuit. Le but du présent ouvrage est de revoir les troubles des rythmes circadiens et du cycle veille-sommeil liés au travail posté ainsi que leurs implications médicales.},

Personality traits were related to 3 dimensions of transformational leadership--idealized influence-inspirational motivation (charisma), intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration--and 3 dimensions of transactional leadership--contingent reward, management by exception-active, and passive leadership. Extraversion was the strongest and most consistent correlate of transformational leadership. Although results provided some support for the dispositional basis of transformational leadership--especially with respect to the charisma dimension--generally, weak associations suggested the importance of future research to focus on both narrower personality traits and nondispositional determinants of transformational and transactional leadership.

  abstract = {Over the past decade there has been an increased interest in studying the factors that affect people's commitment to change. Drawing from the Job Demands–Resources model, in this enquiry we explored the moderating role of two contextual resources (i.e., trust in top management, history of change) and formal communication in the relationship between perceived organizational politics and commitment to change. Data were collected from 2543 employees of 84 companies representing a wide variety of industry sectors. In a first survey we collected data about the work context. Two weeks after the first survey, in a second survey we captured data on people's commitment to change. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to analyse the multilevel character of the data. Consonant with our hypotheses, the findings indicate that the negative relationship between perceived organizational politics and commitment to change is moderated by “trust in top management”, “history of change”, and “formal communication”. As a group the Level 2 predictors account for 18\%, 2.5\%, and 10\%, respectively, of the between-unit variance in continuance, normative, and affective commitment for change.},

In addition, when behavior change is created, the data must be sufficiently reliable to detect it, and we highlight current and needed research in the measurement domain, using response scale research as a prime example.},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.

Specifically, we hypothesized that on days that employees use more self-management strategies, they report higher resources at work and in turn, are more vigorous, dedicated, and absorbed in their work (i.e., engaged) on these days. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 72 maternity nurses who filled out an online diary for 5days (N=360 data points). In line with our hypotheses, results of multilevel structural equation modeling analyses showed that daily self-management was positively related to the resourcefulness of the daily work environment (i.e., more skill variety, feedback, and developmental opportunities) and consequently, to employees' daily work engagement. However, contrary to our expectations, the measurement model showed that two of the five included self-management strategies (i.e., self-reward and self-punishment) loaded onto a separate factor and were unrelated to all job resources. The findings contribute to our understanding of employees' role in regulating their own daily work engagement.},

We compare the unique contribution of these leadership behaviours and focus on the work environment to examine how these leadership behaviours influence followers' daily work engagement. While travelling by sail ship, 61 naval cadets filled out a diary questionnaire for 34 days. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that, after controlling for followers' work engagement the previous day, cadets were more engaged on days that their leader showed more transformational leadership and provided contingent reward. MBE active was unrelated to followers' work engagement. As predicted, transformational leadership and contingent reward contributed to a more favourable work environment (more autonomy and support), while MBE active resulted in a less favourable work environment (less autonomy) for the cadets. This study highlights the importance of daily leadership for followers' daily work engagement. Practitioner points Leaders' daily behaviour influences followers' daily work engagement.

This was the case regardless of the actual occupational rank of the target, such that both a female trainee and a female CEO were given lower status if they expressed anger than if they did not. Whereas women's emotional reactions were attributed to internal characteristics (e.g., ?she is an angry person,? ?she is out of control?), men's emotional reactions were attributed to external circumstances. Providing an external attribution for the target person's anger eliminated the gender bias. Theoretical implications and practical applications are discussed.},

In this paper we identify and clarify a number of common misconceptions about EBMgt. Rather than a single rigid method, EBMgt is a family of approaches that support decision making. It is something done by practitioners, not scholars, although scholars have a critical role to play in helping to provide the infrastructure required for EBMgt. Properly conducted systematic reviews that summarize in an explicit way what is known and not known about a specific practice-related question are a cornerstone of EBMgt. T he virtues of using research evidence to inform management practice have permeated manage-rial writings and organizational research over the past 50 or more years, as the lead article by Reay, Berta, and Kohn (RBK, this issue) points out. Evidence-based management (EBMgt) as a concept in itself is new and can be defined as follows: Evidence-based management is about making decisions through the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of four sources of information: practitioner expertise and judgment, evidence from the local context, a critical evaluation of the best available research evidence, and the perspectives of those people who might be affected by the decision.}

  abstract = {Although there is much research on the links between work and well-being, there is relatively little good-quality research on resource-based or other interventions such as more traditional stress management and job redesign. This paper provides guidance about how to improve the quality of intervention research. First, drawing on the logic of interventions and principles of evidence-based practice, we take the example of a relatively simple resource-oriented intervention to identify 11 key characteristics that we would expect to see in an evidence-based intervention of this type. These characteristics and their underlying principles can be used to evaluate the quality of existing intervention studies and guide the design of future interventions. Second, we discuss an evidence-based approach to reporting the process and the outcomes of interventions. Providing only limited information about an intervention means that it is difficult to replicate or use that method in practice. We describe a checklist developed in a more mature evidence-based field (medicine) that can be used to ensure that sufficient intervention details are reported. Next, we discuss the importance of reporting all the outcomes of all interventions. Last, we consider the ways in which this approach to improving interventions is not only important scientifically and practically but also ethically. Practitioner points Although many resource-oriented well-being interventions are available, their effectiveness is not always known, and they may be implemented without initial diagnosis. An evidence-based practice approach to intervention involves using local organizational evidence as well as evidence from scientific research. Before implementing an intervention, it is important to gather information from the target population to ensure, for example, that there is a significant well-being problem and that it is amenable to change, as well as seeking out research evidence for the efficacy of the intervention. This approach is useful in terms of practice but also helps to ensure that we are working in an ethical way.},

  abstract = {With the burgeoning use of qualitative methods in health research, criteria for judging their value become increasingly necessary. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) is a distinctive approach to conducting qualitative research being used with increasing frequency in published studies. A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify published papers in the area of health psychology employing IPA. A total of 52 articles are reviewed here in terms of the following: methods of data collection, sampling, assessing wider applicability of research and adherence to the theoretical foundations and procedures of IPA. IPA seems applicable and useful in a wide variety of research topics. The lack of attention sometimes afforded to the interpretative facet of the approach is discussed.},

The last decade especially has seen an explosion of work-life balance research, resulting in substantial theoretical and practical advances. However, the published literature on organizational interventions to improve work-life balance is extremely sparse. In this paper, we provide some prominent examples of empirical research concerning work-life balance organizational interventions and note that these fall into three main groups: initiatives addressing working time and/or working hours, collaborative action research focused on improving workplace equity and performance levels, and initiatives to embed work-life balance within organizational cultures. We also comment on some common difficulties faced by researchers in evaluating interventions. The specific examples presented here illustrate challenges to research on the effectiveness of work-life balance interventions. We encourage researchers to reconsider the use of merely descriptive rather than more rigorous research designs and to investigate the long-term effectiveness of organizational strategies to enhance work-life balance.},

Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses on the association of “shadow organizing” with post-epistemologies that are grounded in process ontology. The investigation examines aspects of relational thinking and is guided by John Dewey and Arthur Bentley’s genealogical reconstruction of modes of inquiry. Findings Inquiry is construed in either substantialist or relational ways by researchers. By using the metaphor of “shadow organizing,” the relational aspects of organizational phenomena are prioritized for explorative purposes. Other research objectives are aided by substantialist modes of inquiry. It is the argument of the paper, however, that relational research approaches need not make commitment to process ontology, and that the relational ambitions imbued in the metaphor of shadow organizing are in fact better honored for their methodological virtues. Originality/value The paper’s original contribution consists in critiquing post-epistemological attempts to ground organization studies in ontological first principles of process metaphysics. The paper argues that the metaphor of “shadow organizing” is a promising concept that is better appreciated as a methodological move than an ontological commitment.},

Initiatives have focused particularly upon correcting lifestyle risk behaviours, marking a significant continuity with previous ‘nannying’ policy. On the other hand, nudging represents a departure, even inversion of previous approaches that involved the overstating of risk, being based partly upon establishing a norm that bad behaviours are less, rather than more common than supposed. Despite substantive similarities, its attraction lies in the reaction against the former approach but must also be understood in the context of the economic crisis and a diminished sense of liberty and autonomy that makes intimate managerial intervention seem unproblematic. Problems are, in fact, substantial, as nudging is caught between the utility of unconscious disguised direction and the need to allow some transparency, thereby choice. Further, it assumes clear, fixed ‘better outcomes’ but encourages no development of capacity to manage problems, contradicting a wider policy intent to build a more responsible and active citizenry. More practically, nudging faces considerable barriers to becoming a successfully implemented programme, in the context of severe, Conservativeled austerity with which it is now associated.},

  abstract = {The work of Kurt Lewin dominated the theory and practice of change management for over 40 years. However, in the past 20 years, Lewin's approach to change, particularly the 3-Step model, has attracted major criticisms. The key ones are that his work: assumed organizations operate in a stable state; was only suitable for small-scale change projects; ignored organizational power and politics; and was top-down and management-driven. This article seeks to re-appraise Lewin's work and challenge the validity of these views. It begins by describing Lewin's background and beliefs, especially his commitment to resolving social conflict. The article then moves on to examine the main elements of his Planned approach to change: Field Theory; Group Dynamics; Action Research; and the 3-Step model. This is followed by a brief summary of the major developments in the field of organizational change since Lewin's death which, in turn, leads to an examination of the main criticisms levelled at Lewin's work. The article concludes by arguing that rather than being outdated or redundant, Lewin's approach is still relevant to the modern world.},

The purpose of this paper is to show the ANT methodological aspects, provide an empirical demonstration of this approach as a method, and promote a debate about the implications and importance of understanding it as a method and not just as a theory. Design/methodology/approach By analyzing the criticisms of ANT seminal concepts and its repercussions, the authors have offered an understanding of its methodological aspects and its implications for the practice of research. An empirical study conducted in Brazil is presented to exemplify the use of ANT as a method. Findings The methodological reflection of this approach starts from the recognition that the methods are part of the social world that they research; they are totally imbued with theoretical representations of this world; they are social because they also help to constitute this social world. As a method, ANT seeks to understand the process of stabilizing practices, negotiations and controversies that are established when such practices are in the process of being. In that sense, following the relational disputes that build a practice before their stabilization is the task to be accomplished for the researcher in the field. Research limitations/implications The paper offers relevant contributions to the understanding of ANT as a method. The authors encourage other researchers to venture into the development of this approach in future studies that further explore its methodological character. Originality/value There are not many studies on ANT as a method. If ANT is also a method, can we apply it to any research? The authors hope to bring this matter to discussion, understanding and questioning the use of this theoretical-methodological approach in the research fields.},

In this paper, we argue that much influential work on employee well-being has focused on individualistic, psychological conceptualizations at the expense of a more interdisciplinary approach that takes wider social and contextual realities more fully into account. In particular, we critique the neoliberal emphasis on individual responsibility underpinning work on positive psychology, the psychology of happiness, and resilience in relation to employee well-being. We next draw upon inclusive socio-structural conceptualizations of violence – defined here in terms of the use of power in the employment relationship to implement workplace practices that cause harm – to provide a more contextualized, politicized, and interdisciplinary conceptualization of employee well-being in relation to HRM. Finally, we outline an alternative well-being agenda for research and practice, based on investigating socio-structural types of employee violence transmitted through various HRM practices, types of harm and manifestations of resistance and nonviolence. We argue that such an approach to well-being can, through its greater acknowledgment of types of violence, indignity, and inequality in social systems, complement prevailing psychological approaches and compensate for some of their limitations.},

Peer interactions help children learn from each other to develop their understanding of conversation, emotion, and group norms. In addition, friendships can reduce intergroup bias and prejudice and increase independence. In this article, we review the ways that peers contribute to children’s cognitive and social development in informal and formal settings. Although restrictions are necessary to control the spread of the virus, social restrictions do not have to be to the detriment of peer relations. Based on evidence in developmental psychology, we end with suggestions for parents, teachers, and schools for how to continue to enable children to engage in peer interactions safely throughout future restrictions.},

We provide an overview of the literature on talent management—a body of work that spans multiple disciplines—as well as a clear statement as to what defines talent management. The new themes in contemporary talent management focus on (a) the challenge of open labor markets, including issues of retention as well as the general challenge of managing uncertainty, (b) new models for moving employees across jobs within the same organization, and (c) strategic jobs for which investments in talent likely show the greatest return. We review the conceptual and practical literature on these topics, outline the evolution of talent management over time, and present new topics for future research.},

Although scholars have long considered how leaders communicate visions and values to establish a sense of purpose, they have overlooked how these messages can be used to establish a shared sense of purpose, which is achieved when multiple employees possess the same understanding of the purpose of work. In this research, we move beyond the traditional focus on leader rhetoric and individual cognition to examine leader rhetoric and shared cognition. We suggest that a specific combination of messages--a large amount of vision imagery combined with a small number of values--will boost performance more than other combinations because it triggers a shared sense of the organization's ultimate goal, and, in turn, enhances coordination. We found support for our predictions in an archival study of 151 hospitals and an experiment with 62 groups of full-time employees. In light of these findings, we conducted exploratory analyses and discovered two dysfunctional practices: leaders tend to (1) communicate visions without imagery and (2) over-utilize value-laden rhetoric.},

For every 100 company cars on U.K. roads, 44 are the subject of an insurance claim each year, with many fleet operators recording claims frequencies in excess of 100 or 200\% (Crighton, 1991).

  abstract = {Objective Although there is anecdotal evidence of ageism occurring at both the structural level (in which societal institutions reinforce systematic bias against older persons) and individual level (in which older persons take in the negative views of aging of their culture), previous systematic reviews have not examined how both levels simultaneously influence health. Thus, the impact of ageism may be underestimated. We hypothesized that a comprehensive systematic review would reveal that these ageism levels adversely impact the health of older persons across geography, health outcomes, and time. Method A literature search was performed using 14 databases with no restrictions on region, language, and publication type. The systematic search yielded 13,691 papers for screening, 638 for full review, and 422 studies for analyses. Sensitivity analyses that adjusted for sample size and study quality were conducted using standardized tools. The study protocol is registered (PROSPERO CRD42018090857). Results Ageism led to significantly worse health outcomes in 95.5\% of the studies and 74.0\% of the 1,159 ageism-health associations examined. The studies reported ageism effects in all 45 countries, 11 health domains, and 25 years studied, with the prevalence of significant findings increasing over time (p {$<$} .0001). A greater prevalence of significant ageism-health findings was found in less-developed countries than more-developed countries (p = .0002). Older persons who were less educated were particularly likely to experience adverse health effects of ageism. Evidence of ageism was found across the age, sex, and race/ethnicity of the targeters (i.e., persons perpetrating ageism). Conclusion The current analysis which included over 7 million participants is the most comprehensive review of health consequences of ageism to date. Considering that the analysis revealed that the detrimental impact of ageism on older persons’ health has been occurring simultaneously at the structural and individual level in five continents, our systematic review demonstrates the pernicious reach of ageism.},

A fimdamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing sodal isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others.

  abstract = {Many researchers have concerns about work engagement's distinction from other constructs and its theoretical merit. The goals of this study were to identify an agreed-upon definition of engagement, to investigate its uniqueness, and to clarify its nomological network of constructs. Using a conceptual framework based on Macey and Schneider (2008; Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 1, 3–30), we found that engagement exhibits discriminant validity from, and criterion related validity over, job attitudes. We also found that engagement is related to several key antecedents and consequences. Finally, we used meta-analytic path modeling to test the role of engagement as a mediator of the relation between distal antecedents and job performance, finding support for our conceptual framework. In sum, our results suggest that work engagement is a useful construct that deserves further attention.},

It was hypothesized that the positive or motivating effects of job complexity are only realized when workers are given enough autonomy to effectively meet the challenges of complex jobs. Results show that not only do job complexity and job autonomy interact, but that the relationships to the outcome variables are curvilinear in form. Job complexity is shown to be both a motivator and a stressor when job autonomy is low. However, the most beneficial effects of job complexity occur when it is matched by a high level of job autonomy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

At a given time, an individual's actions are likely to conform to the dictates of the type of norm that are familiar even when the other types of norms dictate contrary conduct. The chapter discusses those injunctive social norms—once activated—is likely to lead to beneficial social conduct across the greatest number of situations and populations. By focusing subjects on one or another type of norm, the action of a particular kind of norm was stimulated, without activating the other kinds.},

The sample comprised 114 voluntary participants (74 females and 40 males) who completed the (i) Exercise Addiction Inventory, (ii) Narcissistic Personality Inventory, and (iii) Ten-Item Personality Inventory, as well as demographic questions and questions concerning their engagement and intensity levels of exercise. Results indicated a low incidence of individuals who were classed as at risk of exercise addiction (7\%), but a high incidence of symptomatic individuals (75\%). Results suggested that extraversion and narcissism may be underlying factors in exercise addiction with no effect for agreeableness. Exercise engagement and intensity were also related to exercise addiction. Further research examining the relationship between personality types and exercise addiction may be useful in identifying individuals at risk for developing exercise addiction.},

This study investigated predictors of ageism to examine which are most important in accounting for ageist attitudes. Participants (N = 419) between the ages of 18 and 86 completed an online survey assessing ageism and several predictors of ageism. Higher levels of anxiety about aging, lower levels of knowledge of aging, and less frequent and lower quality of contact with older adults uniquely predicted ageism beyond the influence of demographic and well-being factors. Anxiety about aging fully mediated the relationship between death anxiety and ageism, and the relationship between attitudes toward own aging and ageism. Moderation analyses showed that knowledge of aging buffered the impact of anxiety about aging on ageism such that low knowledge of aging and high anxiety about aging were particularly impactful in predicting ageism in younger adults, as compared with older adults.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The majority of organizational newcomers have prior work experience. Organizational socialization tactics are less effective for such “experienced newcomers”, relative to graduate newcomers. Hence experienced newcomers tend to rely on their own actions to become socialized. The aim of this article is to assess and potentially extend the range of adjustment strategies identified as being used by experienced newcomers themselves to achieve positive adjustment. Design/methodology/approach – Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 86 experienced newcomers entering a professional services organization. Findings – Nineteen strategies emerged, with seven newly identified in this research. These are compared with strategies found in past research. Practical implications – HR, and the managers and colleagues of newcomers can use the strategies identified and categorized here to encourage newcomers to use organizationally‐appropriate behaviors. Newcomers can use these strategies to help themselves achieve their own adjustment goals. Originality/ value – There is an increasing focus on newcomer proactive behavior in organizational socialization research, yet there are few empirically grounded developments of newcomer adjustment strategies. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to focus on what experienced newcomers report doing to help themselves adjust.},

In 2 studies, we sought to examine the psychometric properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire–Short Form (TEIQue–SF; Petrides, 2009) using item response theory (IRT). Study 1 (N= 1,119, 455 men) showed that most items had good discrimination and threshold parameters and high item information values. At the global level, the TEIQue–SF showed very good precision across most of the latent trait range. Study 2 (N= 866, 432 men) used similar IRT techniques in a new sample based on the latest version of the TEIQue–SF (version 1.50). Results replicated Study 1, with the instrument showing good psychometric properties at the item and global level. Overall, the 2 studies suggest the TEIQue-SF can be recommended when a rapid assessment of trait emotional intelligence is required.},

Until recently, little systematic empirical work had been conducted to explore occupations or groups of workers undergoing transformation and change, although normally not thought to be under particular stress. One occupation which has undergone enormous legislative and occupational change during the last five years or more is the teaching profession (Cole \& Walker. 1989). As the pressure has grown for those in teaching, more research to identify occupational stress has been undertaken, particularly on front line teachers themselves (Kyriacou \& Pratt, 1985: Kyriacou, 1989).},

Statistically significant relationships of varying strengths were found in all three instances.

It plays a major role in a person’s past, it determines the present, and it moulds the future. Not only does it dictate the quality of life-style, but it also provides a major means of personal identity and self-realization. So it is hardly surprising to find that life within complex organizations can prove to be a great source of stress. Because of this, a great deal of research linking stress and health has been focused on occupational stress (Cherry, 1978; Cooper \& Payne, 1978; Cooper \& Marshall, 1980; Cooper \& Smith, 1986). Although the empirical studies in this field are mounting at a quantum rate in the scholarly journals (Mackay \& Cooper, 1987), very little empirical work has been undertaken to understand the dynamics of the stress-health process.},

This article describes conceptual issues in specifying facets of a domain and reports evidence on the validity of NEO-PI-R facet scales. Facet analysis—the interpretation of a scale in terms of the specific facets with which it correlates—is illustrated using alternative measures of the five-factor model and occupational scales. Finally, the hierarchical interpretation of personality profiles is discussed. Interpretation on the domain level yields a rapid understanding of the individual; interpretation of specific facet scales gives a more detailed assessment.},

EI has attracted considerable attention among organizational scholars, and research has clarified the definition of EI and illuminated its role in organizations. Here, I define EI and describe the abilities that constitute it. I evaluate two approaches to measuring EI: the performance-based and self-report approaches. I review the findings about how EI is associated with work criteria, organizing the findings according to three overarching models: the validity generalization, situation-specific, and moderator models. The support for the latter two models suggests that the organizational context and employee dispositions should be considered in order to fully explain how EI relates to criteria. I identify controversies in this area, describe how findings address some controversies, and propose future research to address those that remain. I conclude by listing best practices for future research on the role of EI in organizations.},

Organizational research on the antecedents and consequences of proactive behavior has appeared in several different literatures and has taken different approaches toward defining, measuring, and understanding proactivity. In this article, I review a diverse set of literatures that directly address proactive behavior in organizational contexts. I describe four constructs related to proactive behavior: proactive personality, personal initiative, role breadth self-efficacy, and taking charge. Next, I review six research domains that have explicitly addressed proactive behaviors: socialization, feedback seeking, issue selling, innovation, career management, and certain kinds of stress management. After considering findings from these research streams, I offer an analysis of the different approaches to the study of proactive behavior and provide a set of suggestions for future research.},

According to this hypothesis, happy employees exhibit higher levels of job-related performance behaviors than do unhappy employees. However, despite years of research, support for the happy productive worker thesis remains equivocal. These ambiguous findings result from the variety of ways in which happiness has been operationalized. Researchers have operationalized happiness as job satisfaction, as the presence of positive affect, as the absence of negative affect, as the lack of emotional exhaustion, and as psychological well-being. Some of these measures exhibit appreciable associations with job performance; others do not. The circumplex framework is offered as a potentially useful taxonomy for researchers interested in better understanding and promoting a happy and productive workforce.

In Study 2, we demonstrate that stress mindsets can be altered by watching short, multimedia film clips presenting factual information biased toward defining the nature of stress in 1 of 2 ways (stress-is-enhancing vs. stress-is-debilitating). In Study 3, we demonstrate the effect of stress mindset on physiological and behavioral outcomes, showing that a stress-is-enhancing mindset is associated with moderate cortisol reactivity and high desire for feedback under stress. Together, these 3 studies suggest that stress mindset is a distinct and meaningful variable in determining the stress response. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The main aim of this study was to understand the relationship between self-reported ‘intention’ to transfer and self-reported ‘actual’ transfer within a population of middle and senior executives on an executive education programme. A secondary objective was to consider the relationship between these qualitative self-reports of intent and actual transfer and a quantitative measure of knowledge and skill acquisition immediately post programme. The focus is on ‘what’ is transferred as well as changes in behaviour rather than on identifying and measuring the strength of factors associated with the act of transfer. Practical tools as well as frameworks and ideas designed to foster a change of mindset were mentioned most frequently in terms of both transfer and intention to transfer, thus there was found to be a similar relationship between those aspects of a leadership development programme that participants have already transferred back in to the workplace and those they intend to transfer. In consideration of the secondary objective, the themes that received the largest number of nominations for transfer of learning were also comparable to the skills that gained the highest learning change scores on the questionnaire. It is postulated that the types of learning material used in the executive development programme adhere to four basic principles of learning: active engagement, limited but some prior knowledge, clear applicability back in to the workplace and the opportunity for repeated practice. The implications for programme design to maximize transfer of learning for middle and senior executives, focusing on these four principles, are discussed, along with the importance of executives autonomy in their working environment to facilitate the transfer (or intention to transfer) learning.},

  abstract = {Research on psychological well-being (PWB) in organizational settings is now facing two major challenges. First, conceptual confusion surrounds PWB (Danna and Griffin 1999; Diener 1994; Ryff 1989), and the debate about the superiority of concurrent hedonic, eudaimonic, and integrative approaches is still open. Second, researchers in the organizational sciences mainly study context-free PWB while measuring organizational correlates, despite contextualized non-cognitive measures having proven their incremental validity over context-free measures (e.g. English 2001; Hunthausen et al. 2003). In an attempt to address these issues from a new perspective, an inductive approach was proposed. To confer good content validity to our model of PWB at work (PWBW), a preliminary bottom-up qualitative phase was carried out. On this basis, a quantitative study was conducted. From the 80 manifestations of PWBW obtained, a new instrument was generated and administered to 1,080 workers, supplemented by measures of context-free PWB and distress, of positive and negative affect, and of life satisfaction. Exploratory factor analyses revealed that PWBW can be conceptualized through 5 dimensions, namely, Interpersonal Fit at Work, Thriving at Work, Feeling of Competency at Work, Desire for Involvement at Work, and Perceived Recognition at Work. The questionnaire showed satisfactory internal consistency. Correlational analyses support the “related but distinct” nature of PWBW with regard to context-free hedonic and eudaimonic PWB dimensions and psychological distress indicators. In sum, the study led to the development of a grounded conceptualization of PWBW based on a work frame-of-reference and tied to a reliable and valid measure.},

  abstract = {Objective: Transitional work (TW) for veterans with psychiatric disabilities is the predominant model of vocational rehabilitation in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Although, on average, TW employment outcomes have been demonstrated to be inferior to supported employment, little is known about the potential subgroup of veterans for which TW may be most effective. This study of veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) examines differences in competitive employment outcomes and identifies characteristics of veterans who chose to engage in TW compared with those who did not. Method: A post hoc comparative subgroup analysis of veterans with PTSD randomly assigned to TW as part of a randomized controlled trial was conducted. Veterans were divided into 2 subgroups: those who engaged in TW (n = 141) and nonengagers (n = 129). Differences in baseline characteristics were examined and 18-month employment outcomes were compared. Results: There were no differences in 18-month employment outcomes between TW engagers and nonengagers. Compared with TW engagers, those that did not engage in TW were 2.5 times more likely to get a competitive job within the first 6 months and were less likely to obtain lower skilled jobs. Younger age, adequate housing, personal means of transportation, and recent work history factor into the odds of gaining and maintaining competitive work. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Consistent with past research, engagement in TW did not result in improved long-term competitive employment outcomes for veterans with PTSD. Those who did not engage in TW were more likely to gain a competitive job within the first 6 months. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the viability of knowledge structures as an operationalization of learning in the context of a task that required a high degree of skill. Over the course of 3 days, 86 men participated in 9 training sessions and learned a complex video game. At the end of acquisition, participants ' knowledge structures were assessed. After a 4-day nonpractice interval, trainees completed tests of skill retention and skill transfer. Findings indicated that the similarity of trainees ' knowledge structures to an expert structure was correlated with skill acquisition and was predictive of skill retention and skill transfer. However, the magnitude of these effects was dependent on the method used to derive the expert referent structure. Moreover, knowledge structures mediated the relationship between general cognitive ability and skill-based performance. Formal evaluation is essential to establishing the effectiveness of training programs. One commonly used criterion for evaluating training is measuring the amount of learning that has occurred (Kirkpatrick, 1976, 1996). Recently, much discussion has focused on the empirical relationships shared between different types of training criteria (Alliger \& Janak, 1989; Alliger, Tannenbaum,},

  abstract = {This study applied meta-analysis to assess the relationship between charismatic leadership style and leadership effectiveness, subordinate performance, subordinate satisfaction, subordinate effort, and subordinate commitment. Results indicate that the relationship between leader charisma and leader effectiveness is much weaker than reported in the published literature when leader effectiveness is measured at the individual level of analysis and when common method variance is controlled. Results also indicate a smaller relationship between charismatic leadership and subordinate performance when subordinate performance is measured at the individual level (r = 0.31) than when it is measured at the group level (r = 0.49 and robust across studies). These results suggest that charismatic leadership is more effective at increasing group performance than at increasing individual performance. Other moderators tested did not account for a significant portion of variance in the observed distribution of correlations, suggesting a need for further research into other potential moderators. Meta-analysis examining the effects of charismatic leadership on subordinate effort and job satisfaction revealed lower correlations when multiple methods of measurement were used, with little convergence toward stable population estimates. Résumé La méta-analyse a servi à évaluer le rapport entre le style de leadership charismatique et l'efficacité d'un tel style de leadership ainsi que le rendement, la satisfaction, l'effort et l'engagement des subalternes. Les résul-tats obtenus indiquent que le rapport entre le charisme et l'efficacité du leader est beaucoup plusfaible que le pro-posent les textes publiés à ce sujet lorsque l'efficacité du leader est mesurée au niveau individuel et lorsque la variance de la méthode commune est contrǒlée. Les résultats obtenus révèlent également un rapport moindre entre le leadership charismatique et le rendement des subalternes lorsque ce rendement est mesuré au niveau individuel (r = 0.31) qu'au niveau du groupe (r = 0,49 et notable parmi toutes les études passées en revue). Ces résultats suggèrent qu'un leadership charismatique con-tribue davantage à accroǐtre le rendement du groupe que le rendement individuel. Les autres modérateurs mis à l'essai ne représented pas une portion significative de la variance dans la distribution des corrélations observées, ce qui laisser suggérer qu'une autre recherche serait nécessaire pour vérifier d'autres modérateurs potentiels. La méta-analyse qui étudie l'incidence du leadership charismatique sur l'effort des subalternes et la satisfaction professionnelle démontre des corrélations moins marquées, lorsque des méthodes de mesure multiples one été utilisées, de měme qu'une convergence minime à l'égard des estimations de population stable.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The study aims to contribute to the training‐related literature by investigating the relationship between training and training transfer factors and company‐level training outcomes, and the relationship between the latter and company performance. Design/methodology/approach – The authors propose and test a model linking constructs related to training (the volume and quality of training, supervisor support, peer support, and organisational incentives), constructs related to company‐level training outcomes (the acquisition and interpretation of information, and cognitive and behavioural changes) and company performance. In the empirical analysis the authors use structural equation modelling based on a sample of 247 service companies. Findings – The study confirms a strong relationship between supervisor support and the volume and quality of training as well as between supervisor support and organisational incentives for training transfer. Organisational incentives are directly related to both studied company‐level training outcomes, i.e. the acquisition and interpretation of information, and cognitive and behavioural changes. In addition, they are also indirectly related to company performance through encouraging cognitive and behavioural changes. The volume and quality of training are related only to the acquisition and interpretation of information, while no direct relationship with company performance was found. Research limitations/implications – The study sends an important message to CEOs and HR managers showing them that companies should focus not only on the volume and quality of training but also on important training‐transfer‐related factors. Originality/value – The study complements previous studies dealing with the relationship between training and performance by clearly distinguishing between training and training transfer factors, and by studying their combined relationship with company‐level training outcomes and, through that, with company performance. The links in the model are addressed in a way that has not yet been used in existing literature.},

Combined, leader traits and behaviors explain a minimum of 31\% of the variance in leadership effectiveness criteria. Leader behaviors tend to explain more variance in leadership effectiveness than leader traits, but results indicate that an integrative model where leader behaviors mediate the relationship between leader traits and effectiveness is warranted.},

We begin by outlining some underlying values and assumptions of this model. We then elaborate how our research on political attitudes in post-apartheid South Africa has led us to question, qualify and sometimes reject those assumptions and move towards a ‘contextualist’ perspective on the efficacy of different models of social change. We agree that the project of getting us to like one another may be crucial for producing change in some contexts. In other contexts, however, it is an epiphenomenon that distracts psychologists from the main causes of, and solutions to, problems such as race, class, or gender discrimination. In still others, with an irony that is evidenced increasingly by research, prejudice reduction may actually contribute to the very problem it is designed to resolve. That is, it may diminish the extent to which social injustice is acknowledged, rejected and challenged.},

  abstract = {The present study reconsiders the relationship between personality and leadership by conceptualising personality in terms of factors that occur at the highest levels of breadth in the personality hierarchy. Using metaanalysis, the study examines the relationship between these higher-order factors (i.e., the General Factor of Personality [GFP] and the Big Two factors of Stability and Plasticity) and leadership outcomes (including transformational leadership behaviour and leadership effectiveness). The findings showed that the GFP was positively and more strongly related to leadership than the Big Two and Big Five factors, and that the Big Two factors were more strongly related to leadership than some of their corresponding Big Five factors. Moreover, most lower-order factors did not uniquely predict leadership, over and above the effects of the GFP. These findings challenge current knowledge about the nature of the relationship between personality and leadership. Theoretical contributions, practical implications and future directions are discussed.},

Therefore, we expected that women who observed an unfair situation (involving a victim and a perpetrator) would respond by demonstrating communal prosocial behavior (by compensating the victim), whereas men would respond with agentic prosocial behavior (by punishing the perpetrator). Furthermore, on the basis of social role theory, we expected that gender differences would be more pronounced in countries with a more unequal distribution of men and women in communal and agentic occupational roles. The current research tested the predictions using an economic game. Two studies consisting of samples from 10 countries (Study 1, N = 1,791) and a student sample from Germany (Study 2, N = 193) showed no support for the predicted gender differences in prosocial behavior and no systematic relationship between prosocial behavior and gender roles across countries.},

The purpose of this paper is to assess association of age and dimensions of work engagement. Design/methodology/approach In total, 181 participants completed the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) to measure work engagement including the dimensions of absorption, vigor and dedication as well as demographics. One-way ANOVA and post hoc tests were conducted to examine the relationship between age and work engagement. Findings Employees 50 years of age and older were found to have statistically significant higher work engagement scores than the employees under the age of 50. Statistically significant scores were also found to be higher in absorption and dedication. Originality/value The workforce is aging with older employees becoming larger populations in organizations. Understanding how age influences employee work engagement supports human capital management strategy within organizations. HR professionals can also use the findings to develop targeted employee engagement to leverage the dedication and talents of older employees.},

In addition, the relationships between transformational leadership, employee psychological empowerment, and job-related behaviors are hypothesized to be stronger in organizations with more organic as opposed to mechanistic structures. Results based on a cross-organizational sample of employees and their immediate supervisors provide support for the hypothesized relationships. Psychological empowerment mediated relationships between transformational leadership and employee task performance and organizational citizenship behaviors. The mediating role of psychological empowerment was then found to be conditional upon mechanistic–organic contexts. More specifically, organic structures enhanced, whereas mechanistic structures constrained, the empowering influence of transformational leaders. In highly mechanistic contexts, the indirect effects were no longer statistically significant. Implications for theory, research, and organizational management are discussed.

One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles.

  abstract = {Objectives Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a form of biotechnological surgery which has had considerable success for the motor improvement of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Paradoxically, this observed motor improvement is not matched with improved psychosocial adjustment. This study contributes to a small but growing body of research aiming to understand this paradox. We conclude by discussing these aspects from a phenomenological and health psychology understanding of decision-making, human affectivity, and embodiment. Design A hermeneutic phenomenological case study. Methods Semi-structured interviews with one woman with Parkinson's disease were carried out paying particular attention to (1) how the decision to have the procedure was made and (2) the affective experience in the time periods immediately prior to the procedure, shortly after and 1 month later. Results The thematic structure derived from the hermeneutic phenomenological analysis comprises the following experiential aspects: Making the decision: ‘I was feeling rather at a dead end with my Parkinson's’; Shifting emotions and feelings: ‘Terrified, excited, disappointed, overjoyed’; Embodied meaning: ‘This extraordinary procedure where they were going to drill holes in my head’. Conclusions This research has elucidated the complexity of decision-making, the emotional landscape, and specific bodily nature of the experience of DBS. It has suggested implications for practice informed by both existential-phenomenological theory and health psychology. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a newly developed form of biotechnological surgery and research indicates a mismatch between motor success and psychosocial adjustment. Most studies focuses on life post-DBS and there is relatively little research on how people make the decision to have the procedure, what their experience is of undergoing it including its emotional aspects. What does this study add? This study demonstrates that making decisions with respect to health and illness is complex and best understood as a form of embodied cognition. Findings indicate that the experience of undergoing DBS surgery is one of multiple emotions, especially fear and feelings of ‘unhomelikeness’. This study highlights the relevance of a lifeworld, people-centered and humanizing approach to helping health care professionals support people through an illness/treatment trajectory.},

These enable the IPA researcher to make well-judged inferences, which can have value beyond the individual case.ConclusionsA key feature of IPA is its commitment to an idiographic approach that recognises the value of understanding a situated experience from the perspective of a particular person or persons.},

Organizational culture impacts on most aspects of organizational life, especially when it comes to people and their relationships. Even though it is widely acknowledged that culture plays an important role in social network building and the qualities of these connections, there has not been much research on it. Therefore, the question which usually arises is which type of organizational culture is most likely to have a positive influence on the intra-organizational networks and lead to a higher density of the network. Based on a literature study and a case study analysis of two Austrian organizations, the authors’ aimed at providing some clarifications on the impact of organizational culture on the density of intra-organizational networks.

The P-E fit approach characterizes stress as a lack of correspondence between characteristics of the person (e.g. abilities, values) and the environment (e.g. demands, supplies). This lack of correspondence is hypothesized to generate deleterious psychological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes, which eventually result in increased morbidity and mortality. This basic framework forms the core of many current theories of organizational stress, such as those presented by French and his colleagues (French, Rogers and Cobb, 1974; French, Caplan and Harrison, 1982), McGrath (1976), Karasek (1979), Schuler (1980), and others.},

We aggregated employee perceptions of the internal service quality received from corporate units and the local service climate and external customer perceptions of service quality to the branch level of analysis.

By reanalyzing data based on a heterogeneous sample of 5288 UK employees, the results show that the 22-item instrument has a high internal stability, with three underlying factors: personal bullying, work-related bullying and physically intimidating forms of bullying, although the instrument may also be used as a single factor measure. Criterion validity was explored by relating the scores on the NAQ-R to a single-item measure of perceived victimization from bullying, showing high correlations with both the total NAQ-R and scores on the three factors. Targets of bullying scored significantly higher on all 22 items compared to non-targets. The NAQ-R correlated as expected with measures of mental health, psychosocial work environment and leadership, indicating a good construct validity of the instrument. Furthermore, a latent class cluster (LCC) analysis showed that the instrument may be used to differentiate between groups of employees with different levels of exposure to bullying, ranging from infrequent exposure to incivility at work to severe victimization from bullying and harassment. The more commonly used operational criteria can also be used to detect targets of bullying. Hence, the NAQ-R is proposed as a standardized and valid instrument for the measurement of workplace bullying.},

We argue that followers vary in terms of their sensitivity toward and processing of moral information, as conveyed by ethical leaders, and that these individual differences determine the strength of the link between ethical leadership and follower discretionary work behaviors. In a multisource study with 135 leader–follower dyads, we examine two prototypical examples of affective and cognitive individual differences that involve a heightened inclination toward morality: follower moral emotions and follower mindfulness. Our findings indicate that ethical leadership is more strongly related to follower extra effort and helping at higher levels of follower moral emotions and higher levels of follower mindfulness. We discuss the implications of this moral information processing perspective on ethical leadership for research and managerial practice. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Emotion has become one of the most popular—and popularized—areas within organizational scholarship. This chapter attempts to review and bring together within a single framework the wide and often disjointed literature on emotion in organizations. The integrated framework includes processes detailed by previous theorists who have defined emotion as a sequence that unfolds chronologically. The emotion process begins with a focal individual who is exposed to an eliciting stimulus, registers the stimulus for its meaning, and experiences a feeling state and physiological changes, with downstream consequences for attitudes, behaviors, and cognitions, as well as facial expressions and other emotionally expressive cues. These downstream consequences can result in externally visible behaviors and cues that become, in turn, eliciting stimuli for interaction partners. For each stage of the emotion process, there are distinct emotion regulation processes that incorporate individual differences and group norms and that can become automatic with practice. Although research often examines these stages in relative isolation from each other, I argue that each matters largely due to its interconnectedness with the other stages. Incorporating intraindividual, individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels of analysis, this framework can be a starting point to situate, theorize, and test explicit mechanisms for the influence of emotion on organizational life. We keep coming back to feelings, I'll have time for feelings after I'm dead. Right now we're busy.

Study 3 showed that the core trait was related to task activity, productivity as measured by sales volume, and the rated performance of insurance agents. Results also revealed that the core self-evaluations trait was related to goal-setting behavior.

Recent research examines the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of individual resistance and how it is influenced by: individual predispositions towards openness and resistance to change; individuals' considerations of threats and benefits of change; communication, understanding, participation, trust in management, management styles, and the nature of relationships with the change agents.Research limitations/implications– This paper is limited to research articles involving resistance to organizational change published in peer‐reviewed journals from 1998 to 2009. Also, the paper finds that reported research used primarily self‐report questionnaires to gather data, which are quantitatively analyzed. Such a lack of diversity of research methodologies provides a limited perspective of resistance to organizational change that might have been broadened by qualitative and practice‐based methods (e.g. case studies and action research).Practical implications– A framework is presented linking organizational change research findings to specific change practitioner recommendations. Limitations of recent research are also discussed.Originality/value– Most studies provide an examination of a limited number of variables influencing resistance to change, and are not necessary designed to provide practical guidance to change practitioners. This paper provides a comprehensive framework of constructs and variables specifically aimed at linking research‐based findings to guidance for change practitioners.},

In this paper we use social psychological and sociological theories to explore the anticipated effects on xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes worldwide. Based on our analysis, we discuss recommendations for further research required during the ups and downs of the pandemic, as well as during recovery. We also discuss the need for research to address how to best counteract this expected surge in xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes. As the pandemic persists, it will be important to systematically examine its effects on xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes, and to develop and implement strategies that keep these negative attitudes at bay.},

In addition, the influence of social support for training from four organizational constituents (top management, supervisors, peers, and subordinates) and task constraints in the work environment on pretraining motivation and training transfer were evaluated. Nine hundred sixty-seven managers and supervisors completed a questionnaire that assessed 14 constructs. Structural equations analysis with LISREL VII indicated that the overall reputation of training, intrinsic and compliance incentives, organizational commitment, and three social support variables (subordinate, supervisor, and top management support) were predictive of pretraining motivation. In addition, pretraining motivation and subordinate, peer, and supervisor support were predictive of managers’ perceived training transfer. These findings suggests that previous theory and research (e.g., Noe, 1986; Noe \& Schmitt, 1986) serve as a useful heuristic for predicting the effects of general beliefs about training on training effectiveness. Implications of the-findings for future research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Complementing previous studies on the antecedents of abusive supervision at the organizational and individual level, this study investigates how a team-level factor (i.e., team performance) influences abusive supervision. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, we propose that low team performance may elicit abusive supervision by making supervisors emotionally exhausted. Furthermore, when faced with low team performance, supervisors with a high prevention focus may experience greater emotional exhaustion and thus display more abusive behaviours, while supervisors with a high promotion focus may be less likely to feel emotionally exhausted and thereby exhibit fewer abusive behaviours. We tested our hypotheses using three-wave survey data collected from 130 teams within an organization. Findings showed that supervisors' emotional exhaustion mediated the negative effect of team performance on abusive supervision, while only prevention focus moderated the indirect effect of team performance on abusive supervision via emotional exhaustion. This study contributes to the literature on antecedents of abusive supervision, the relationship between abusive supervision and performance, and leadership literature broadly. Practitioner points As abusive supervision results from psychological stress in a specific form of emotional exhaustion, organizations need to improve supervisors’ stress-management skills by designing relevant training or education programmes, and help them handle or recover from stress. The study’s identification of the specific stressor (i.e., low team performance) fostering abusive supervision can increase organizations’ awareness of the issue and enable them to take appropriate interventions to reduce abusive supervision. Confronted with low team performance, highly prevention-focused supervisors become more emotionally exhausted and are therefore more likely to abuse subordinates. Thus, in organizations where such a stressor (i.e., low team performance) is salient, practitioners can hire supervisors with a low prevention focus, or assess, select, and promote supervisors based on their prevention focus.},

This research was conducted in two occupational settings (nurses and school principals), using a distinct variable operationalization for each. Results of both studies provide support for the hypothesized model, suggesting that TFL relates to optimal job functioning (psychological health, job attitudes and performance) by contributing to favourable perceptions of job characteristics (more resources and less demands) and high-quality work motivation (more autonomous motivation and less controlled motivation) in employees. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications as well as directions for future research are presented.},

  abstract = {Background: Performance-based financing (PBF) is currently tested in many low- and middle-income countries as a health system strengthening strategy. One of the main mechanisms through which PBF is assumed to effect change is by motivating health workers to improve their service delivery performance. This article aims at a better understanding of such motivational effects of PBF. In particular, the study focused on organizational context factors and health workers’ perceptions thereof as moderators of the motivational effects of PBF, which to date has been little explored. ,  Methods: We conducted a multiple case study in 2 district hospitals and 16 primary health facilities across three districts. Health facilities were purposely sampled according to pre-PBF performance levels. Within sampled facilities, 82 clinical skilled healthcare workers were in-depth interviewed one year after the start of the PBF intervention. Data were analyzed using a blended deductive and inductive process, using self-determination theory (SDT) as an analytical framework. ,  Results: Results show that the extent to which PBF contributed to positive, sustainable forms of motivation depended on the "ground upon which PBF fell," beyond health workers’ individual personalities and disposition. In particular, health workers described three aspects of the organizational context in which PBF was implemented: the extent to which existing hierarchies fostered as opposed to hindered participation and transparency; managers’ handling of the increased performance feedback inherent in PBF; and facility’s pre-PBF levels in regards to infrastructure, equipment, and human resources. ,  Conclusion: Our results underline the importance of leadership styles and pre-implementation performance levels in shaping health workers’ motivational reactions to PBF. Ancillary interventions aimed at fostering participatory as opposed to directional leadership or start-up support to low-performing health facilities will likely boost PBF effects in regards to the development of valuable motivational capacities.},

This paper reviews what is known about the definition, causes and consequences of happiness at work, drawing also on insights from the expanding positive psychology literature on happiness in general. Many discrete organizational behavior constructs arguably belong to a larger family of happiness-related constructs, and share some common causes and consequences. Happiness at work includes, but is far more than, job satisfaction. A comprehensive measure of individual-level happiness might include work engagement, job satisfaction, and affective organizational commitment. Aspects of happiness have been (and should be) conceptualized and measured at multiple levels, including transient experiences, stable person-level attitudes, and collective attitudes, and with respect to multiple foci, such as discrete events, the job, and the organization. At all levels, there is evidence that happiness has important consequences for both individuals and organizations. Past research has tended to underestimate the importance of happiness at work.},

In this paper we document some of the most glaring gender inequalities that have arisen in the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how social psychological theories and research—including work on gender stereotypes and roles, responses to threat, precarious masculinity, perceptions of risk, and backlash—can help to explain the roots of these inequalities. In doing so, we use a broad definition of gender and consider relevant intersections of identity. Finally, we present three key considerations for research on gender inequalities moving forward. Namely, the need for social psychologists to (a) challenge binary conceptualizations of gender, (b) broaden the focus of research on gender inequalities, and (c) adopt an intersectional lens to address systemic inequalities in the wake of COVID-19.},

As a result of this, the research on the subject has moved beyond the limited confines of measurement issues and accuracy of performance ratings and has begun to focus more of social and motivational aspects of appraisal. This article identifies and discusses a number of themes and trends that together make up the developing research agenda for this field. It breaks these down in terms of the nature of appraisal and the context in which it operates. The former is considered in terms of contemporary thinking on the content of appraisal (contextual performance, goal orientation and self awareness) and the process of appraisal (appraiser-appraisee interaction, and multi-source feedback). The discussion of the context of appraisal concentrates on cultural differences and the impact of new technology. In reviewing these emerging areas of research, the article seeks to explore some of the implications for appraisal practice at both organizational and individual levels.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review and critique the variety of definitions, concepts, and theories of psychological resilience. To this end, the narrative is divided into three main sections. The first considers how resilience has been defined in the psychology research literature. Despite the construct being operationalized in a variety of ways, most definitions are based around two core concepts: adversity and positive adaptation. A substantial body of evidence suggests that resilience is required in response to different adversities, ranging from ongoing daily hassles to major life events, and that positive adaptation must be conceptually appropriate to the adversity examined in terms of the domains assessed and the stringency of criteria used. The second section examines the conceptualization of resilience as either a trait or a process, and explores how it is distinct from a number of related terms. Resilience is conceptualized as the interactive influence of psychological characteristics within the context of the stress process. The final section reviews the theories of resilience and critically examines one theory in particular that is commonly cited in the resilience literature. Future theories in this area should take into account the multiple demands individuals encounter, the meta cognitive and -emotive processes that affect the resilience-stress relationship, and the conceptual distinction between resilience and coping. The review concludes with implications for policy, practice, and research including the need to carefully manage individuals’ immediate environment, and to develop the protective and promotive factors that individuals can proactively use to build resilience.},

We offer three prescriptions: (a) going one step beyond most existing studies to offer greater precision in our specification and measurement of variables and interventions, (b) connecting the dots by focusing on transfer criteria and transfer trajectories, and (c) shifting the operative paradigm of research to examine contemporary learning from a problem-centered perspective. There is ample opportunity to increase the yield on enormous organizational investments in training if transfer scholars and practitioners are fully informed of what is known and prepared to systematically confront the unknown in new and innovative ways.},

Design/methodology/approach Cyberbullying is explored through the lens of Erving Goffman’s theories on everyday life interaction and social media scholars understanding of social life on the internet today. The empirical material for the study is grounded in eight in-depth interviews with individuals who have been subjected to cyberbullying behavior in their professional life. The interview data were analyzed by means of thematic analysis. Findings Three key themes were identified: spatial interconnectedness, colliding identities and the role of the audience. The empirical data indicate that in order to understand cyberbullying in working life, it is necessary to consider the specific context that emerges with social network sites and blogs. Moreover, this study shows how social network sites tend to blur boundaries between the private and the professional for the targeted individual. Originality/value Cyberbullying in working life is a relatively under-researched area. Most existing research on cyberbullying follows the tradition of face-to-face bullying by addressing the phenomenon with quantitative methods. Given the limited potential of this approach to uncover new and unique features, this study makes an important contribution by exploring cyberbullying with a qualitative approach that provides in-depth understanding of the new situations that emerge when bullying is performed online.},

One hundred thirty-eight col-lege students completed self-report measures of affect and coping at two assessment periods 5 weeks apart. As hypothesized, regression analyses showed that initial positive affect, but not negative affect, predicted improved broad-minded coping, and initial broad-minded coping predicted increased positive affect, but not reductions in nega-tive affect. Further mediational analyses showed that positive affect and broad-minded coping serially enhanced one another.

However, the simple dichotomy between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation made the theory difficult to apply to work settings. Differentiating extrinsic motivation into types that differ in their degree of autonomy led to self-determination theory, which has received widespread attention in the education, health care, and sport domains. This article describes self-determination theory as a theory of work motivation and shows its relevance to theories of organizational behavior. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature on talent management by offering an in-depth review of the talent concept within the specific context of the world of work, and proposing a framework for its conceptualization. We group different theoretical approaches to talent into ‘object’ (i.e., talent as natural ability; talent as mastery; talent as commitment; talent as fit) versus ‘subject’ approaches (i.e., talent as all people; talent as some people) and identify dynamics existing within and between them, as well as implications for talent management theory and practice. Finally, we discuss different avenues for further research aimed at developing the talent—and consequently, the talent management—construct further.},

Most past meta-analytical reviews of these relationships focused only on the linkages of role conflict and role ambiguity with job performance, none of them related to unpublished studies, and each included only a relatively small number of samples, casting doubt on their findings regarding the effect of possible moderators (e.g., Abramis, 1994, n = 18 for role ambiguity only; Fisher \& Gitelson, 1983, n = 25, 22; Jackson \& Schuler, 1985, n = 37, 24; Tubre \& Collins, 2000, n = 74, 54 for the meta correlations of performance with role ambiguity and role conflict, respectively). All previous meta-analytical reviews found that a substantial amount of the variance in the corrected stressor-performance correlations remained unexplained and urged future researchers to identify variables that moderate this relationship (e.g., Tubre \& Collins, 2000, p. 166).},

To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test–retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures.},

  abstract = {Does task significance increase job performance? Correlational designs and confounded manipulations have prevented researchers from assessing the causal impact of task significance on job performance. To address this gap, 3 field experiments examined the performance effects, relational mechanisms, and boundary conditions of task significance. In Experiment 1, fundraising callers who received a task significance intervention increased their levels of job performance relative to callers in 2 other conditions and to their own prior performance. In Experiment 2, task significance increased the job dedication and helping behavior of lifeguards, and these effects were mediated by increases in perceptions of social impact and social worth. In Experiment 3, conscientiousness and prosocial values moderated the effects of task significance on the performance of new fundraising callers. The results provide fresh insights into the effects, relational mechanisms, and boundary conditions of task significance, offering noteworthy implications for theory, research, and practice on job design, social information processing, and work motivation and performance.},

We draw upon the SIRDE/IDEAS model of social change to explore how the pandemic might have affected complex reactions to social injustices. We argue that the virus elicits widespread negative emotions which are spread contagiously through social media due to increased social isolation caused by shelter-in-place directives. When an incident occurs which highlights systemic injustices, the prevailing negative emotional climate intensifies anger at these injustices as well as other emotions, which motivates participation in protest actions despite the obvious risk. We discuss how the pandemic might shape both normative and non-normative protests, including radical violent and destructive collective actions. We also discuss how separatism is being encouraged in some countries due to a lack of effective national leadership and speculate that this is partially the result of different patterns of social identification.},

Employees have needs (e.g., a desire to be authentic) and they also have expectations for how their job or their organization will fulfill them. We argue that experiences at work that confirm employees’ need fulfillment expectations yield a positive emotional state that is energizing, and that this energy is manifested in employees’ behaviors at work. Our theorizing draws on a review of the work engagement literature, in which we identify three core characteristics of work engagement: (a) a positive emotional state that (b) yields a feeling of energy and (c) leads to positive work-oriented behaviors. These key themes provide the foundation for further theorizing suggesting that interactions at work confirm or disconfirm employees’ need fulfillment expectations, leading to different levels of engagement. We extend our theorizing to argue that confirmation, or disconfirmation, of different need expectations will yield emotional experience of varying magnitudes, with confirmation of approach-oriented need expectations exerting stronger effects than the confirmation of avoidance-oriented need expectations. We close with a review suggesting that organizational contextual features influence the expression of these needs, sustaining or undermining the positive emotional experiences that fuel work engagement.},

In addition, the data reveal that unit COB performance influences unit profitability by enhancing revenues without a concomitant increase in costs. The study’s results underscore the theoretical importance of considering cross-level influencers of employee-level relationships and suggest that managers should focus on creating a climate that is supportive of COBs if their units are to profit from the recruitment, hiring, and retention of customer-oriented employees.},

Being fat was related to weakness of will and lack of control by all age groups, and discourses of blame were used to describe those who were overweight. Sixteen-year-olds described peer pressure to be slender and muscular, and two young men had experienced teasing about their body size. Adult men and teenagers explicitly linked having a well-toned, muscular body with feelings of confidence and power in social situations.

  abstract = {The present study aims at exploring the critical role of motivation to transfer within the training transfer process. In a sample of N = 252 employees of one industrial company, one peer rating and several self-ratings of transfer were used to investigate the mediating role of motivation to transfer in the relationship between training characteristics and training transfer. We furthermore used an online survey with N = 391 employees from different branches to corroborate the first analysis in a more diverse sample and to explore differential effects of motivation to transfer. The participants' motivation to transfer was successfully identified as a mediational link between training characteristics and transfer. Moreover, quantile regression revealed that the positive effects of motivation to transfer on training transfer differ across quantiles. Understanding the role of motivation to transfer within the transfer process in greater detail helps to identify crucial parameters for successful transfer. Because motivation to transfer was found to be a linking mechanism between training characteristics and transfer, training professionals should enhance it by means of different instructional methods. Quantile regression results point out that motivation to transfer should especially be emphasized and monitored depending on characteristics of the training participants. The present study answers the call for research on the mediating role of motivation to transfer in the transfer process. This is one of the first studies that successfully applied quantile regression to training transfer research, suggesting new directions for future research.},

Researchers have long examined the ‘transfer problem’, uncovering a wealth of information regarding the transfer of training. Inconsistencies remain, however, and organizations may find it difficult to pinpoint exactly which factors are most critical. Using Baldwin and Ford's model of transfer, we identify the factors relating to trainee characteristics (cognitive ability, self-efficacy, motivation, perceived utility of training), training design (behavioral modeling, error management, realistic training environments) and the work environment (transfer climate, support, opportunity to perform, follow-up) that have exhibited the strongest, most consistent relationships with the transfer of training. We describe our reasoning for extracting such variables from the literature and conclude by discussing potential implications for practice and future research.},

It sets out an agenda for policy and practice designed to increase its chances of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a review of the research and analytic literature. It outlines the origins, reasons for growth of popularity, main forms and evidence about the antecedents and impact of employee engagement. It draws a distinction between work engagement and organizational engagement. For the former it outlines a research agenda; for the latter, it presents an extensive critique and an agenda to address the issues raised. Findings A distinction is highlighted between work engagement with its concern to improve employee well-being and organizational engagement with its focus on organizational performance. It is shown that these two approaches operate in “different worlds” and that this reflects a neglect of an evidence-based approach to management of employees since work engagement has much the stronger evidence base. Research limitations/implications As a review and analysis, the paper is inevitably selective and limited by space restrictions. However, it argues that while work engagement is now well-established among the academic community as a valid and useful construct, the same cannot be said for organizational engagement which lacks clear definition, measurement, high-quality evidence and clear policy implications. The paper therefore sets out a policy agenda and outlines how some of the shortcomings might be addressed. Practical implications The paper highlights the need for a viable and integrated “engagement strategy” if organizational engagement is to thrive in the future and sets out the core elements of such an approach. Originality/value The paper highlights the distinction between the two separate “engagement worlds” of work and organizational engagement and also highlights their different core aims. The problems with organizational engagement are analysed and a new agenda to improve its prospects of impact is outlined.},

Findings: Group-level transformational leadership predicted followers' mastery goals, whereas group-level transactional leadership predicted followers' performance goals. Within-group differences in transformational leadership also predicted mastery goals. Implications: These findings suggest that leadership style plays an important role in the achievement goals followers adopt. Organizations may promote transactional leadership in contexts requiring that employees outperform others. In contrast, in contexts requiring learning and development, organizations may promote transformational leadership. Originality/Value: This research is the first to examine the relationships between leadership styles and specific follower goals, and the first to highlight the role of leadership as a social variable involved in employees' adoption of achievement goals.},

In particular, the study seeks to examine the relationship between two personality traits, extraversion and conscientiousness with engagement amongst frontline employees. The Utrecht work engagement scale (2003) and Big Five Personality scale (McCrae and Costa, 1989) have been used for this purpose. Primary data was collected from 333 frontline employees working in different retail formats. The study finds that there is considerable scope for improvement in the level of employee engagement amongst the frontline personnel in the organized retail industry. There, however does exist a positive relationship between the extraversion and conscientiousness personality traits and employee engagement. Based on the findings, the paper recommends measures for improving employee engagement levels through a better fit between employee personality and the retail work environment.},

  abstract = {This study used discourse analysis to explore the way in which employees understand work stress. Twenty-two female clerical workers in a Canadian city participated in focus group meetings where they talked about and made sense of their experiences of work stress. The women's accounts were analysed using discourse analysis methods (i.e. an examination of how talk is constructed). The findings revealed that talking about being stressed provides a socially acceptable way of expressing discomfort and regaining a sense of importance that is lost through feeling under-valued and under-appreciated in the organization. In contrast, admitting to being unable to cope with stress was considered to be ‘abnormal’. The stress discourse fosters a sense of helplessness and ambiguity by not acknowledging external influences on clerical workers’ experiences, such as their place within the power structure of the organization, and by limiting their sense of agency and control over problems experienced at work. The implications of these findings for organizational culture and interventions are discussed. For example, employers are encouraged to be conscious of the messages being sent to employees about how negative emotions or distressing experiences at work are to be addressed (i.e. how ‘stress’ is to be managed). Recommendations are made for future research using discourse analysis, such as the examination of alternative discourses that aim to improve conditions at work.},

This review is concerned with those who work other schedules either on shifts or with extended hours which transcend the day-night work-sleep pattern. Such abnormal” working hours are not a modern phenomenon. Ramazzini (1633–1714) noted that bakers, innkeepers, and soldiers worked such hours. The advent of the industrial revolution led to many people working long hours until legislation was introduced to curtail the worst vicissitudes of the new factory based economy. \#\#\# SHIFT SCHEDULES Today, about one in five workers in Europe are employed on shift work involving night work and over one in 20 work extended hours . Shift systems involve periods of 6–12 hours work at a time with the shift crews alternating on two, three, or four shifts in any 24 hour period. The traditional three shifts start at 0600, 1400, and 2200 hours but there are many variations on this. Some workers only work on the two day shifts, some only nights, while others rotate through all three shifts with variable degrees of speed of rotation and direction of rotation. Extended hours of work is generally accepted to mean working more than 48 hours a week. This can occur on either day work or shift work due to either a high number of hours worked per day or a higher number of days worked per week.\#\#\#\# Box 1: Summary of EC Working Time Directive},

However, customer loyalty, employee retention, revenue, sales, and profit are essential to the success of any business. It is known that these outcomes are correlated with employee attitudes and perceptions of work conditions, but the research into direction of causality has been inconclusive. Using a massive longitudinal database that included 2,178 business units in 10 large organizations, we found evidence supporting the causal impact of employee perceptions on these bottom-line measures; reverse causality of bottom-line measures on employee perceptions existed but was weaker. Managerial actions and practices can impact employee work conditions and employee perceptions of these conditions, thereby improving key outcomes at the organizational level. Perceptions of specific work conditions that engage employees in their work provide practical guidance in how best to manage people to obtain desired results.},

The paper also tests theoretical suppositions undergirding the CVF by investigating the framework’s nomological validity and proposed internal structure (i.e., interrelationships among culture types). Results based on data from 84 empirical studies with 94 independent samples indicate that clan, adhocracy, and market cultures are differentially and positively associated with the effectiveness criteria, though not always as hypothesized. The findings provide mixed support for the CVF’s nomological validity and fail to support aspects of the CVF’s proposed internal structure.

Their review covered the period from 1979 to 1997. The present paper updates and extends this review. Covering research from 83 studies published between 1998 and 2007, our review revealed three major results: First, support for additive effects of demands, control, and social support on general psychological well-being is almost always found if the sample size is sufficient. Second, although there was consistent evidence for additive effects in relation to job-related well-being in cross-sectional studies, support rates were lower in longitudinal data. Thus, reciprocal or reversed causation might account for part of the association between JDC/JDCS dimensions and job-related well-being. Finally, evidence for interactive effects as predicted by the buffer hypotheses of the JDC/JDCS model was very weak overall. However, the pattern of results indicates that this is due neither to spurious evidence for such interactions nor to small effect sizes. Instead, our results suggest that buffering effects depend on whether or not demands and control are based on qualitatively identical JDC/JDCS dimensions (matching principle).},

This paper attempts to offer support to air navigation service providers that have already implemented a standardized safety culture survey approach, in the process of transforming their safety culture based on existing survey results. First, an overview of the state of the art with respect to safety culture is presented. Then the application of the CANSO safety culture model from theory into practice is demonstrated based on four selected case studies. Finally, a summary of practical examples for driving safety culture change is provided, and critical success factors supporting the safety culture transformation process are discussed.

The aim of this study was the explorative documentation of the experience of PTG among breast cancer patients and the role, if any, that a group based physical activity intervention had in the attainment of growth. Ten female breast cancer survivors, from an already existing study, participated in an individual, open-ended interview. Employing interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA), interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed for themes that reflected the women’s experience of growing from adversity. The women attributed much of their process and outcomes of PTG to the experience of participating in an exercise intervention programme during rehabilitation. The programme’s success in facilitating PTG could be viewed as superior in some ways to other group based therapies in offering the women a safe environment, positive support system, opportunity to transfer new skills and heightened health awareness/ behaviours. Future research should acknowledge and conduct further investigations into the role of physical activity interventions as facilitators of the PTG process.},

However, psychology and clinical practices and most recently positive psychology have been criticized for their indifference toward the influence of the body on positive psychological functioning. The aim of this study was to broaden the understanding of PTG, including its process and outcomes, using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Ten female breast cancer survivors, from an already existing study, participated in an individual, open-ended interview. These were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for themes that reflected the women’s experience of growing from adversity. The role of the body was found to be a vital component to the process and outcomes of PTG and was deconstructed into three smaller themes: fear of new body, negative effects of chemotherapy on the body (fatigue, loss of desire), and reconnection with body (cocoon to butterfly, listening to body, body as a barometer/monitoring). In addition, the analysis revealed how these 10 women perceived the body as an integral component to their self-identity and how this affected their achievement of PTG. Future research should begin to acknowledge and conduct further study into the neglected role of the body as a contributor or determinant of the PTG process.},

In the normal population, the five factor scores appear to be internally consistent, stable and valid. As regards specific (e.g. clinical) populations, still further study is needed. The item pool for the FFPI was constructed interactively in Dutch, English and German versions, and proved to be relatively easy to translate into still other languages.

In a second experiment, we found that higher bonuses associated with higher levels of perceived manager discretion enhanced procedural fairness but those based on lower discretion did not. In a third field study, we found that actual bonuses implemented by a service organization enhanced intrinsic motivation indirectly through procedural fairness, but only when employees perceived their bonus to be based on higher levels of perceived manager discretion. Conversely, when bonus level was associated with lower perceived manager discretion, it negatively predicted of intrinsic motivation.},

Respondents can selectively enhance their positive traits while downplaying negative ones. Consequently, it can be difficult to achieve an accurate representation of personality when there is motivation for favourable self-presentation. In the current study, we developed a relative-scored Big Five measure in which respondents had to make repeated choices between equally desirable personality descriptors. This measure was contrasted with a traditional Big Five measure for its ability to predict GPA and creative achievement under both normal and ‘‘fake good” response conditions. While the relative-scored measure significantly predicted these outcomes in both conditions, the Likert questionnaire lost its predictive ability when faking was present. The relative-scored measure thus proved more robust against biased responding than the Likert measure of the Big Five.},

Current conceptualizations of stress are challenged as being too phenomenological and ambiguous, and consequently, not given to direct empirical testing. Indeed, it is argued that researchers have tended to avoid the problem of defining stress, choosing to study stress without reference to a clear framework. A new stress model called the model of conservation o f resources is presented as an alternative. This resource-oriented model is based on the supposition that people strive to retain, protect, and build resources and that what is threatening to them is the potential or actual loss of these valued resources. Implications of the model of conservation of resources for new research directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Conservation of resources (COR) theory has become one of the two leading theories of stress and trauma in the past 20 years, along with the pioneering theory of Lazarus and Folkman (1984). COR theory emphasizes objective elements of threat and loss, and common appraisals held jointly by people who share a biology and culture. This places central emphasis on objective reality and greater focus on circumstances where clear stressors are occurring, rather than a focus on personal appraisal. Although originally formulated to focus on major and traumatic stress, COR theory has also become a major theory in the field of burnout and the emerging field of positive psychology. This chapter reviews the principles of COR theory and covers new ground by examining more closely aspects of resource gain cycles and how they might contribute to resilience.

However, prevalence figures vary greatly between individual studies and between countries. In part this discrepancy reflects the use of different research methods. In general two main approaches may be identified: one group of studies follows, broadly speaking, the approach developed by Leymann (1992), where respondents are presented with an inventory of negative behaviours identified with bullying. Bullying is then operationalized by defining the criteria for when a person is being bullied. In Leymann’s study of bullying in Sweden, bullying was defined as weekly or more frequent exposure to at least one negative act or behaviour for a period of at least 6 months. In line with this approach Leymann found that 3.5\% of respondents in his representative study of the Swedish working population were bullied. In an Austrian replica study the results span 17.5\% to 26.6\% depending upon occupational group surveyed (Niedl, 1995). By contrast, an alternative method has been to measure the prevalence of bullying by means of a “global” definition of bullying. Thus, those who consider their experience within a certain timescale to fit the definition will be considered to have been bullied.},

First, from 1964 to 1976, we worked with the California Psychological Inventory (CPI: Gough, 1975), and by 1976 we had a substantial set of archival data on hand. We had read Norman's (1963) research but regarded it as lacking practical significance. To test this view, we constructed CPI content scales based on Norman's taxonomy, and reanalyzed our archival data. We found that the CPI content scales substantially outperformed the standard scales, and this persuaded us that future inventories of normal personality should be based on the Five-Factor Model. Second, although we had no desire to develop a personality inventory, the major inventories at the time were perhaps 30 years old, and none of them were likely to be reconfigured in terms of the FFM. We began working on the HPI as a teaching exercise in a graduate course in psychometrics and one thing led to another. We arrived at the current (1995) version of the inventory through a constant process of evaluation and revision over a period of 20 years.

Group identification, as self-categorization, constructs an intragroup prototypicality gradient that invests the most prototypical member with the appearance of having influence; the appearance arises because members cognitively and behaviorally conform to the prototype. The appearance of influence becomes a reality through depersonalized social attraction processes that make followers agree and comply with the leader's ideas and suggestions. Consensual social attraction also imbues the leader with apparent status and creates a status-based structural differentiation within the group into leader(s) and followers, which has characteristics of unequal status intergroup relations. In addition, a fundamental attribution process constructs a charismatic leadership personality for the leader, which further empowers the leader and sharpens the leader-follower status differential. Empirical support for the theory is reviewed and a range of implications discussed, including intergroup dimensions, uncertainty reduction and extremism, power, and pitfalls of prototype-based leadership.},

These results suggest that, in order to enhance transfer of training, organizations should focus more on creating environments that enhance coworker support, at least in the short term. However, for the longer term, organizations must improve the quality of other types of support as well in order to more effectively exploit the opportunities for training transfer.},

Although many studies have examined the foundation issues and outcomes of service climate, there is a lack of a comprehensive model explicating the antecedents, outcomes, and moderators of service climate. The current study fills this void in the literature. By conducting a meta-analysis of 58 independent samples (N ϭ 9,363), we found support for service climate as a critical linkage between internal and external service parameters. In addition, we found differential effects of service-oriented versus general human resource practices and leadership on service climate, as well as disparate impacts of service climate contingent on types of service, measures of service climate, and sources of rating. Research and practical implications are discussed.},

We collected data by means of a 2‐week diary study with two daily measurements (in the morning before work and at the end of the workday) among 109 fulltime working interns. Multi‐level analyses showed that the positive relationship between daily satisfaction of the need for relatedness at work and employee well‐being at the end of the workday was stronger for participants who expressed a high strength of this need. Furthermore, on workdays when participants experienced higher satisfaction of the needs for competence and autonomy, they experienced higher well‐being. Although we did not find moderating effects of need strength for these two needs, results did indicate between‐individual variance in the strength of the associations between satisfaction of these needs and employee well‐being. Practitioner points: Daily satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness at work should be supported, because this relates positively to employee well‐being.Enabling work‐related satisfaction of the need for relatedness is especially important for employees who exhibit a strong strength of this need.},

Consistent with hypotheses, the three types of i-deal had differential effects on work characteristics, and each in turn related to different outcomes. Specifically, job autonomy mediated the task i-deals—job performance relationship; skill acquisition mediated the career i-deals—occupational self-efficacy relationship; and reduced work overload mediated the flexibility i-deals—emotional and affective irritation relationships. Leader–Member Exchange was confirmed as an antecedent of all three types of i-deals.

Furthermore, we tested 2 randomized interventions designed to help participants attain desired trait changes. Although 1 of the interventions was inefficacious, a second intervention that trained participants to generate implementation intentions catalyzed their ability to attain trait changes. We also tested several theoretical processes through which volitional changes might occur. These studies suggest that people may be able to change their self-reported personality traits through volitional means, and represent a first step toward understanding the processes that enable people to do so.

The definition of successful job performance varies greatly across roles and organizations. Thus, while some elements of behaviour are important for all jobs (e.g., exertion of effort), it is likely that many other behavioural patterns will be suited to performance in some roles but not others. This straightforward observation has led to a broad consensus from industry and academia that personality testing, which as we discuss below is the fundamental descriptor of human behaviour, should be useful during selection programmes. However, whether and to what extent personality is useful remains a contested issue. In this chapter we critically consider the evidence regarding the use of personality assessments in selection. We begin by setting the scene of personality test use in selection before defining personality, considering why it should be of value in selection and briefly considering how we arrived at the current state of knowledge in personality research generally. We then examine the predictive validity evidence for personality in selection, considering personality as a single predictor of job performance and as a part of a broader selection programme. We then explore debates regarding what level of the personality hierarchy (broad factors vs. narrow traits) is more useful during selection, whether universal job performance exists or whether different jobs require different behaviours and thus nuanced personality assessment, and we consider the potential utility of other ratings' of personality. We then move on from predictive validity and discuss how and when personality measures might be used within a selection programme. Finally, we suggest areas of research that offer great promise for improving our understanding, and subsequently evidence-based practice within selection.

Whereas deep acting refers to deliberate attempts to modify felt emotions and involves conscious effort, automatic regulation refers to automated emotion regulatory processes that result in the natural experience of desired emotions and do not involve deliberate control and effort. Multilevel analyses revealed that both types of emotion regulation were positively associated with customer tips. The second study was an experimental field study using a sample of German hairdressers (N ϭ 41). Emotion regulation in terms of both deep acting and automatic regulation was manipulated using a brief self-training intervention and daily instructions to use cognitive change and attentional deployment.

Although no connection between work environment and OC is found when countries are compared on the basis of literature on the differences in the organization of production, the connection proves to be salient with respect to individual and group levels. The result suggests that the most important factor for OC in all countries is a job that the individual finds interesting. A control for job satisfaction makes it clear that the effect of finding the work interesting is independent of satisfaction with work. Other similarities and differences between the countries are also identified and discussed. New avenues for further comparative research are suggested.},

Drawing from motivated information processing and proactivity perspectives, the model hypothesizes that employees’ customer-oriented perspective taking enhances their role breadth self-efficacy (RBSE), which in turn enhances proactive customer service performance and proactive complaint-handling performance. A three-wave, time-lagged study, involving 145 frontline employees and their immediate supervisors in the Chinese hospitality industry, tests the research model. The results of structural equation modelling show taking customers’ perspectives results in a high level of RBSE. This relationship grows stronger if employees exhibit a strongly proactive personality. A high level of RBSE also mediates the interactive effects of customer-oriented perspective taking and proactive personality on proactive customer service performance and proactive complaint-handling performance. These findings provide insights for research on perspective taking, RBSE, and proactive service performance. Practitioner points Taking customers’ perspectives results in a more satisfactory service encounter and significantly enhances employees’ service performance.

That is, we propose that an affective mechanism by which charismatic leaders induce positive emotional experiences in their followers, and a cognitive mechanisms that includes communicating the leader's vision and its effects on goal setting explain the connection between charismatic and transformational leadership and follower motivation. Further, we specify the pathways through which affective and cognitive processes influence three components of follower motivation: The direction of action, the intensity of effort, and effort persistence.

Results based on 50 independent samples (N = 9,324) indicate a moderately strong, positive relationship between LMX and citizenship behaviors (ρ=.37). The results also support the moderating role of the target of the citizenship behaviors on the magnitude of the LMX-citizenship behavior relationship. As expected, LMX predicted individual-targeted behaviors more strongly than it predicted organizational targeted behaviors (ρ = .38 vs. ρ = .31), and the difference was statistically significant. Whether the LMX and the citizenship behavior ratings were provided by the same source or not also influenced the magnitude of the correlation between the 2 constructs.

  abstract = {Effective coaching and mentoring is crucial to the success of individuals and organizations, yet relatively little is known about its neural underpinnings. Coaching and mentoring to the Positive Emotional Attractor (PEA) emphasizes compassion for the individual's hopes and dreams and has been shown to enhance a behavioral change. In contrast, coaching to the Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA), by focusing on externally defined criteria for success and the individual's weaknesses in relation to them, does not show sustained change. We used fMRI to measure BOLD responses associated with these two coaching styles. We hypothesized that PEA coaching would be associated with increased global visual processing and with engagement of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), while the NEA coaching would involve greater engagement of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Regions showing more activity in PEA conditions included the lateral occipital cortex, superior temporal cortex, medial parietal, subgenual cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and left lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to visioning, PNS activity, and positive affect. Regions showing more activity in NEA conditions included medial prefrontal regions and right lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to SNS activity, self-trait attribution and negative affect.},

Transformational/charismatic leadership was shown to be positively related to affective (AC; ρ = .451, k = 116) and normative commitment (NC; ρ = .337, k = 30), while contingent reward and management-by-exception (active) were positively related to AC (ρ = .369, k = 51 and ρ = .083, k = 25, respectively). Laissez faire leadership was negatively related to AC (ρ = −.296, k = 15). In terms of culture, societal individualism-collectivism did not affect the relationship between transformational/charismatic leadership and AC. In contrast, the relationship between transformational/charismatic leadership and both NC and continuance commitment was stronger in countries that value collectivism. We also found evidence that the relationship between contingent reward and AC was stronger in societies with higher rather than lower levels of power distance/hierarchy. Implications of these findings on the study of leadership, culture, and commitment are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose – Organizational change is a risky endeavour. Most change initiatives fall short on their goals and produce high opportunity and process costs, which at times outweigh the content benefits of organizational change. This paper seeks to develop a framework, offering a theoretical toolbox to analyze context‐dependent barriers and enablers of organizational change. Starting from an organizational identity perspective, it aims to link contingency‐based approaches, such as environmental scan, SWOT and stakeholder analysis, with insights from organizational behaviour research, such as knowledge sharing and leadership. Design/methodology/approach – The framework is informed by long‐lasting field research into organizational change in an international policing environment. The theories in the framework are selected from the perspective of field validity in two ways; they were chosen because the topics covered by these theories emerged as relevant during the field research and therefore it can be expected they have applicability to the field. The authors' insights and suggestions are summarised in 13 propositions throughout the text. Findings – The analysis provides a clear warning that organizational change is more risky and multifaceted than change initiators typically assume. It is stressed that the external environment and the internal dynamics of organizations co‐determine the meaning of managerial practices. This implies that cure‐all recipes to organizational change are bound to fail. Originality/value – This paper makes an ambitious attempt to cross disciplinary boundaries in the field of organizational change research to contribute to a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of change processes by integrating perspectives that focus on the internal context and the external environment of organizations.},

However, the issue of whether the mechanism is motivational, as expected, has not been tested. This article finds support for such expectations using a vignette survey experimental setup of 1,150 responses (from 384 respondents). The results indicate that PRP positively affects organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), but that the effect is reduced significantly when PRP is perceived as a control factor, because the importance of intrinsic motivation for effort is weakened. Thus, PRP can cause a cognitive shift from intrinsic to extrinsic orientation, but only if PRP is perceived as controlling. When PRP is perceived as noncontrolling, the importance of intrinsic motivation can actually increase. The findings imply that PRP is not necessarily harmful, and that managers should pay close attention to how their employees perceive performance-based pay systems.},

Managers have been encouraged to make adjustments to differences in job conditions that are important to older workers. We use social exchange theory and the norm of reciprocity as a framework for examining six dimensions of job quality for their impact on employee engagement among several groups of older and younger workers at different points in the cycle of their careers in a large retail setting. Employees (N = 6047) were surveyed as part of a large-scale research project. Exploratory factor analyses identified commonalities among 27 job quality variables and four reliable factors. Regression analyses estimated the relationship between four job conditions and employee engagement. Although the relative weights of the factors differed by career stage, the same factors: (1) Supervisor Support and Recognition; (2) Schedule Satisfaction; and (3) Job Clarity were significant predictors of employee engagement for all age groups; (4) Career Development was a predictor for all but the retirement-eligible employees. Findings reveal the importance of recognizing age diversity among both young and old employees. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Across two studies, socially anxious participants exhibited a disjunction between subjective ratings and physiological responses. Whereas anxious individuals reported more anxiety and negative affect during a stressful public speaking task relative to nonanxious controls, no differences emerged in physiological reactivity as a function of anxiety. In the second experiment socially anxious and nonanxious participants instructed to reframe stress arousal as a positive coping tool exhibited reduced attentional bias and improvements in physiological functioning: decreased vasoconstriction and increased cardiac efficiency. This research suggests that outcomes in SAD may be improved by reappraising stress arousal.},

Many participants reported a highly stressful workplace, including ambiguous roles, staff shortages and high levels of conflict, as well as inappropriate social behaviours being carried out by others in addition to themselves.

The current study examined associations among gender, social skills, and the bystander intervention model among 299 sixth- to eighth-grade students. Analyses revealed that girls reported significantly greater cooperation and empathy, and noticed bullying events, interpreted them as an emergency, and intervened more often than boys. The best fitting structural equation model included both empathy and cooperation, with significant positive path coefficients between empathy and bystander intervention. Students with greater empathy were more likely to engage with each step of the model, except noticing the event. Assertiveness was positively associated and cooperation was negatively associated with greater knowledge of how to intervene.},

  abstract = {This paper integrates elements from the theory of agency, the theory of property rights and the theory of finance to develop a theory of the ownership structure of the firm. We define the concept of agency costs, show its relationship to the ‘separation and control’ issue, investigate the nature of the agency costs generated by the existence of debt and outside equity, demonstrate who bears these costs and why, and investigate the Pareto optimality of their existence. We also provide a new definition of the firm, and show how our analysis of the factors influencing the creation and issuance of debt and equity claims is a special case of the supply side of the completeness of markets problem. The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it. Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.

  abstract = {Organizations face a progressively ageing workforce and jobs with direct customer contact are growing, creating challenging issues from a human resource management perspective. Drawing on socioemotional selectivity theory and lifespan development findings, this study focuses on the research gap in the service sector with regard to age, emotional labour, and associated positive and negative outcomes. Analyses using data from 444 service employees in Germany revealed age is negatively directly related to exhaustion and cynicism, and positively directly related to professional efficacy, as well as positively directly linked to engagement. Additionally, age predicts less burnout and more engagement indirectly through the use of the emotion regulation strategies surface acting and anticipative deep acting. This provides evidence against the general deficit hypothesis of age, which assumes a decline of employee skills and abilities with age. We find no evidence that older workers are worse than younger workers, with older workers using positive emotion regulation strategies, being more engaged and less burnt out. Resumen Las organizaciones se enfrentan a una mano de obra cada vez más envejecida y los puestos de trabajo de contacto con el público, en aumento, están planteando problemas desde la perspectiva de gestión de los recursos humanos. Basándonos en de la teoría de la selectividad socioemocional y en los descubrimientos sobre la evolución de la duración de la vida, este estudio centra su atención en el vacío de investigación que hay en el sector público con respecto a la edad, el trabajo emocional y resultados asociados positivos y negativos. Los análisis con 444 empleados en el sector servicios de Alemania han puesto de manifiesto que la edad se relaciona de un modo directo negativamente con el agotamiento emocional y con el cinismo, así como positivamente con la eficacia profesional y también con la implicación laboral. Además, la edad predice menos burnout y más compromiso laboral indirectamente, a través de la actuación superficial y de la actuación anticipatoria profunda mediante la utilización de estrategias de regulación emocional. Este hecho es una prueba contra la hipótesis de déficit general de la edad, que supone que las destrezas y aptitudes de los trabajadores disminuyen con la edad. No hemos comprobado que los trabajadores mayores sean peores que los jóvenes; es más, utilizan estrategias positivas de regulación emocional, tienen una mayor implicación laboral y un menor burnout.},

Research on the dispositional source of job satisfaction has had a spotty history in job satisfaction research. The personological basis of job satisfaction was considered in the earliest treatments of job satisfaction. Hoppock (1935), for example, noted a strong correlation between workers ’ emotional adjustment and their lev-els of job satisfaction. Similarly, Fisher and Hanna (1931) con-cluded that a large part of dissatisfaction resulted from emotional maladjustment. With some noteworthy exceptions (P. C.

The aim of this paper is to identify the distinct effects of economic, social, and political factors on the adoption of performance-related pay practices and their coverage (i.e. the proportion of employees covered by the practices) by integrating institutional and agency theories. An empirical analysis is performed with a unique sample of Korean firms that experienced the East Asian financial crisis of 1997. The results show that while performance-related pay adoption was influenced by economic and social factors, performance-related pay coverage was related to political factors as well as economic and social factors. This finding suggests that while firms adopt performance-related pay practices in search of legitimacy, they do not blindly imitate such practices but rather proactively adapt them based on economic efficiency considerations. This study makes valuable contributions to research on institutionalism and remuneration by empirically identifying the conditions under which a pay practice adopted for social legitimacy fits or fails to fit the economic needs of the adopters.},

  abstract = {Three experimental studies with different participant pools examined the effects of displays of empathic anger – anger that is caused by witnessing or learning of harm done to another person – on perceptions of men and women in leadership positions. In contrast to prior work, which focused on expressions of anger regarding personal failure and found double standards that favour men, the results in this study show that displays of empathic anger were significantly more beneficial for female leaders. In particular, female leaders who expressed anger about a harm done to a subordinate were perceived as possessing more agentic and communal characteristics, and as being more effective in their position, than their male counterparts. Moreover, the results showed that this effect was driven by observers' tendency to attribute empathic anger expressed by female compared with male leaders more strongly to internal reasons like the leader's personality. Consistent with these findings, the different perceptions of male and female leaders were no longer present when attributions for the displays of empathic anger were clearly internal. Practitioner points: To be effective leaders, female managers need to show qualities like determination and confidence, but unlike male leaders, they often find it difficult to do so without simultaneously been judged as lacking important attributes like warmth and kindness.The results in this study suggest that female leaders can overcome this problem by expressing anger about a harm done to others, which causes observes to judge them even more positively than male leaders who engage in the same behaviour.Overall, whereas female leaders should generally avoid expressing anger about a personal harm for which they are judged very negatively, they should not be reluctant to display anger about harm done to other members of organization when they have the opportunity to do so.},

The research was conducted using Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method and Gilbert's Behavior Engineering Model as its frameworks. The three key factors identified by study participants as having an impact upon their ability to conduct Level 3 and Level 4 evaluations were the availability of resources such as time and personnel, managerial support (organizational) and expertise in evaluative methodology (individual). The research findings indicated a need to further explore how training professionals interpret Level 3 and Level 4 and how they can better develop their evaluative expertise, which in turn may increase effectiveness in gaining organizational support for evaluation efforts.},

The editors argue that the concept of occupational stress and its corollary, coping, may not be useful concepts for moving forward and that the implicit adoption of a psychomedical model for understanding workers’ reactions to work demands has hindered progress in this field. Finally, there is a lack of good research on stress management interventions, but on the basis of current evidence, it is concluded that there are few benefits to workplaces implementing many such programs. It is speculated that the concept of occupational stress has had its day and that a return to a focus on occupational stressors and worker fatigue, where the field originated, might be more productive.},

Although there is general support for the assessment model adopted by this approach, to date, there has been no empirical investigation of the relationship between the actual MS (as measured by the final revised version of the HSE Indicator Tool) and stress-related work outcomes.Aims To investigate the relationship between the HSE MS and the following stress-related work outcomes: ‘job satisfaction’, job-related anxiety and depression and errors/near misses.Methods An anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed by either e-mail or post to all employees within a community-based Health and Social Services Trust. Respondents completed the HSE Indicator Tool, a job-related anxiety and depression scale, a job satisfaction scale and an aggregated measure of the number of errors/near misses witnessed. Associations between the HSE Indicator Tool responses and stress-related work outcomes were analysed with regression statistics.Results A total of 707 employees completed the questionnaire, representing a low response rate of 29\%. Controlling for age, gender and contract type, the HSE MS (as measured by the HSE Indicator Tool) were positively associated with job satisfaction and negatively associated with ‘job-related anxiety’, ‘job-related depression’ and ‘witnessed errors/near misses’.Conclusions This study provides empirical evidence to support the use of the MS approach in tackling workplace stress.},

Three main antecedents to negative emotions in ongoing change are proposed: perceptions of an insecure future; perceptions of inadequate working conditions; and perceptions of inadequate treatment by the organization. Two outcome variables are identified: trust in the organization and withdrawal from the organization. The model is tested with cross-sectional and follow-up data from a field study. Regression and path analysis reveal that: a) ongoing changes are associated with negative emotions; b) this relationship between ongoing changes and emotions is mediated by the three proposed antecedents; and c) negative emotions predict employee lack of trust and employee withdrawal, both immediately and one month later.

Considering the importance of an individual's subjective perception, they hypothesized that perceived pace and scope of organizational change would increase an employee's feelings of uncertainty, which would, in turn, result in stronger organizational identification. The authors also predicted that employee perceptions of boundary permeability between organizations would moderate the proposed relationships. Employees working in Korean firms participated in a survey to report on their experience of major organizational changes, their feelings of uncertainty, and organizational identification. The results of the analyses supported the proposed hypotheses: both the mediating effect of uncertainty and the moderating effect of boundary permeability.

In spite of this popularity, there is a scarcity of empirical research on work engagement in the academic literature.

Contrary to the myths about older workers being less engaged, statistics have shown that the level of engagement is higher as people age. Within the broad framework of conservation of resources theory in the area of work engagement, the current study aims to clarify how older workers are more engaged at work than younger workers. Building upon socioemotional selectivity theory and continuity theory from a life-span perspective, we explain how individuals gain more resources as they age, including the abilities to regulate emotion and to maintain a career identity. We argue that this positive relationship between age and resources explains why older people have high levels of work engagement. We tested our predictions with a sample of 613 workers in the United States. The study demonstrates that well-regulated emotion and strong commitment to career mediate the positive relationship between age and work engagement simultaneously. These findings contribute to the understanding of an aging workforce's engagement in the workplace. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Previous research on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has overwhelmingly been conducted within a medical or psychiatric framework, and has failed to explore women’s own experience of the syndrome. Interviews were conducted with 30 women with PCOS recruited through a national self-help organisation. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed pervasive reports of feeling ‘freakish’, ‘abnormal’, and not ‘proper’ women. These feelings were related to three symptoms commonly experienced by women with PCOS: ‘excess’ hair growth; irregular, absent or disrupted periods; and infertility. Smooth hairless bodies and faces, regular menstruation and the capacity to bear children were associated with femininity, and as a result of their symptoms women expressed feeling ‘different’ from other women and less ‘feminine’. The results are discussed within a feminist framework and suggest that polycystic ovarian syndrome is a deeply stigmatising condition, ‘a theft of womanhood’, with far reaching implications for all women, whether or not they conform to ‘feminine’ norms. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Possible reasons for the persistence of the conventional account are described. Recognizing self-transcendence as part of Maslow's hierarchy has important consequences for theory and research: (a) a more comprehensive understanding of worldviews regarding the meaning of life; (b) broader understanding of the motivational roots of altruism, social progress, and wisdom; (c) a deeper understanding of religious violence; (d) integration of the psychology of religion and spirituality into the mainstream of psychology; and (e) a more multiculturally integrated approach to psychological theory.},

Lifespan theories point to subjective health and future time perspective (i.e. an individual’s perceptions of his or her remaining time to live) as potentially relevant age-related variables. Using two Dutch samples, a health care company (N = 448) and university employees (N = 1271), we examined whether subjective health and future time, perceived as open-ended or limited, mediate the relation between age and work-related motivations (growth, security, esteem and generativity), and whether those motivations in turn influence work engagement. In line with lifespan theories, the study demonstrated that the relations of chronological age with work-related growth, esteem and security motivations were mediated by an open-ended future time perspective and a good subjective general health. The association between age and generativity motivations was not mediated by a limited future time perspective. Furthermore, growth, esteem and generativity motivations had a positive association with work engagement. These findings imply that the future time perspective and subjective health of older workers should be taken into account, and not just chronological age, when examining or managing their occupational well-being.

However, most of the prior research has been conducted at the level of the individual, not organization. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine how an organization's ethical climate has a positive influence on two its performance indicators – customer satisfaction and financial performance – with a perspective of organizational innovation. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from 29 subsidiaries of a conglomerate in South Korea. Hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares (PLS). Findings The result showed that an organization's ethical climate was positively related to customer satisfaction as well as financial performance, and this relationship was mediated by perceived organizational innovation. Additionally, the positive influence of an ethical climate on employees’ perceived organizational innovation was mediated by their organizational commitment and the climate for innovation. Originality/value With a focus on innovation, the study explained how an organization's ethical climate influences customer satisfaction and financial performance. Furthermore, as was the case in studies conducted in other developed countries, the results derived from South Korea sample demonstrated that an ethical climate is critical for organizational performances in developing countries.},

Building on extensive fieldwork, we observe a gradual shift from claim-based, street mobilizations to locally embedded solidarity initiatives that addressed social reproduction needs in relation to food, health, education and housing. We illustrate how this foregrounded social reproductive practices; challenged traditional divisions of labour and the temporalities and spatialities of movement organizing; and brought forward the value of building intersectional coalitions and of embracing affect and radical care. Despite the lack of explicitly articulated feminist values and principles, we argue that many social movements of the crisis therefore have cultivated situated and implicit modes of feminist solidarity that warrant further attention. Accordingly, we discuss the implications for feminist organizing and radical social movements more broadly.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

This special issue was developed to foreground the crucial role of group processes and intergroup relations in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides an overview of the areas explored in the special issue. First, we focus on the impact on societies, covering the evolution of intergroup processes during the pandemic, leadership, social connectedness, cultural differences in responses, and social development. Second, we turn to intergroup inequality and focus on gender inequality, ageism, xenophobia, and racial bias during COVID-19. Third, we explore worldviews during the pandemic, specifically conspiracy theories, science skepticism, and existential threat. Finally, we focus on the pandemic’s impact on behaviors, covering virtual working, social activism, virtual ostracism, and conformity and deviance. We finish with a discussion of the value of social psychology in helping us understand the impact of COVID-19 on social attitudes and behavior. As this special issue shows, group processes and intergroup relations are central to the ways that individuals and society is dealing with the challenges of this pandemic.},

We used a stereotype threat framework to investigate the impact of threat-inducing (young manager, young workgroup, manual occupation) and threat-inhibiting (high performance practices, mature-age practices) contextual cues on mature-age worker engagement. A total of 666 mature-age employees in Australia described their work experiences in three surveys administered over a three-year period. Results indicated that mature-age employees who experienced stereotype threat in the workplace reported lower engagement 11–12 months later. All of the contextual cues had an impact on stereotype threat and exerted indirect (mediated by stereotype threat) effects on engagement. However, the effects of manager age were moderated by organizational practices. Diversity conscious mature-age practices moderated the indirect effect of manager age, so mature-age practices were particularly beneficial in counteracting negative cues associated with young managers. But diversity blind high performance practices moderated the direct effect of manager age, so high performance practices were especially helpful in generating engagement among mature-age workers with older managers. We recommend that organizations adopt both diversity blind and diversity conscious practices into their diversity management portfolios. The two types of practices are complementary and have additive effects on mature-age worker engagement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

A cross-sectional survey of 593 employees from 64 Norwegian savings banks showed that performance appraisal satisfaction was directly related to affective commitment and turnover intention. The relationship between performance appraisal satisfaction and work performance, however, was both mediated and moderated by employees' intrinsic work motivation. The form of the moderation revealed a negative relationship for employees with low intrinsic motivation and a positive relationship for those with high intrinsic motivation.

To help address this issue, this meta-analysis estimates the extent to which leadership training is effective and identifies the conditions under which these programs are most effective. In doing so, we estimate the effectiveness of leadership training across four criteria (reactions, learning, transfer, and results; Kirkpatrick, 1959) using only employee data and we examine 15 moderators of training design and delivery to determine which elements are associated with the most effective leadership training interventions. Data from 335 independent samples suggest that leadership training is substantially more effective than previously thought, leading to improvements in reactions (δ = .63), learning (δ = .73), transfer (δ = .82), and results (δ = .72), the strength of these effects differs based on various design, delivery, and implementation characteristics. Moderator analyses support the use of needs analysis, feedback, multiple delivery methods (especially practice), spaced training sessions, a location that is on-site, and face-to-face delivery that is not self-administered. Results also suggest that the content of training, attendance policy, and duration influence the effectiveness of the training program. Practical implications for training development and theoretical implications for leadership and training literatures are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

We expected burnout to be characterized by high neuroticism and low extraversion, and engagement by low neuroticism and high extraversion. Additionally, we predicted that burnout would correlate negatively with the temperament traits (strength of excitation, strength of inhibition, and mobility), whereas work engagement would correlate positively. Discriminant analyses were used to distinguish burned-out and engaged employees from their non-burned-out and non-engaged counterparts, respectively. Results showed that high neuroticism is the core characteristic of burnout, whereas work engagement is characterized by low neuroticism in combination with high extraversion and high levels of mobility. Thus, personality and temperament make a difference as far as burnout and work engagement are concerned.},

The purpose of this study was to provide theory-based empirical evidence on whether employee evaluations of self (i.e., core self-evaluations) and perceptions of organizational work environment (i.e., psychological climate) affect employee engagement. Kahn's theory of three psychological conditions and Demerouti and her associates’ job demands–resources model were used for theoretical frameworks. Data were collected from 394 hotel line-employees and managers in the United States. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that core self-evaluations and four components of psychological climate (i.e., customer orientation of the management, managerial support for service, internal service, and information-sharing communication) were positively associated with employee engagement. Managerial implications for human resource practice and future research directions are provided.},

Much less is known about how loneliness affects patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as somatic symptoms, which are increasingly important for guiding symptom management and assessing quality of patient care. The current study investigates whether (a) loneliness and social isolation predict cold symptoms independent of each other, and (b) whether loneliness is a more robust risk factor than objective social isolation for experiencing cold symptoms. Method: As part of a larger parent study, 213 healthy participants completed the Short Loneliness Scale (LON) and the Social Network Index (SNI) at baseline. They were given nasal drops containing rhinovirus 39 (RV39; i.e., a common cold virus), then quarantined for 5 days during which they reported on subjective cold symptoms in addition to being monitored for objective indicators of infection. Data from 160 of the participants (who were infected with the virus) were used in the present analyses. Results: A hierarchical multiple regression revealed that baseline loneliness predicted self-reported cold symptoms over time (assessed via area under the curve), over and above demographic variables, season of participation, and depressive affect. Interestingly, social network size and diversity did not predict cold symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the perception of loneliness is more closely linked to self-reported illness symptoms than objectively measured social isolation. Assessing psychosocial factors such as loneliness when treating and evaluating the common cold could contribute to health care practitioners’ understanding of their patients’ experiences with acute illness.},

The point of departure is a discussion of the critique that has been raised of AR, and the article suggests that through a discussion of what is the essence of social science research, the solution may be found in the formation process ‘Bildung’ of action researchers. The final sections of the article introduce four factors that would support high rigor in writing scientific texts for communicating research findings: research partnering; controlling biases; standardized methods; and alternative explanations. These factors would then secure trustworthy rigorous research and proper dissertations.},

These standards describe what should be included in a research report to enable and facilitate the review process. This publication marks a historical moment—the first inclusion of qualitative research in APA Style, which is the basis of both the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA, 2010) and APA Style CENTRAL, an online program to support APA Style. In addition to the general JARS–Qual guidelines, the Working Group has developed standards for both qualitative meta-analysis and mixed methods research. The reporting standards were developed for psychological qualitative research but may hold utility for a broad range of social sciences. They honor a range of qualitative traditions, methods, and reporting styles. The Working Group was composed of a group of researchers with backgrounds in varying methods, research topics, and approaches to inquiry. In this article, they present these standards and their rationale, and they detail the ways that the standards differ from the quantitative research reporting standards. They describe how the standards can be used by authors in the process of writing qualitative research for submission as well as by reviewers and editors in the process of reviewing research.},

The refocused research has shown that positive and negative age stereotypes held by older individuals can have beneficial and detrimental effects, respectively, on a variety of cognitive and physical outcomes. Drawing on these experimental and longitudinal studies, a theory of stereotype embodiment is presented here. It proposes that stereotypes are embodied when their assimilation from the surrounding culture leads to self-definitions that, in turn, influence functioning and health. The theory has four components: The stereotypes (a) become internalized across the life span, (b) can operate unconsciously, (c) gain salience from self-relevance, and (d) utilize multiple pathways. The central message of the theory, and the research supporting it, is that the aging process is, in part, a social construct.},

The term CFS is usually preferred, because it makes no assumptions about aetiology and does not imply a unitary phenomenon.

  abstract = {Literature on change management has changed over the years. Under the umbrella of change management today frequently holistic approaches are discussed. The special significance of soft factors results from the area of tension of subjective/personal risk assessment of certain groups of actors, which entail comprehensive changes. As change projects depend on implementation by executives and employees, change communications is a form of (internal) strategic stakeholder management. Change communications can be identified as the single part of change management, which focuses on the soft factors that are activated through the change of hard factors. With the management of soft factors the aim is to make a contribution to the enforcement of change goals, i.e. to secure or to regain the management's power. For this purpose 60 PR-agencies in Germany have been polled, as to how they assess the possibilities and reality of change communications. The result illustrates a torn of the agency scene between service and consulting claims, which emphasizes the question, if (internal) communication means the organization of messages and its delivery or also becomes part of behavioral economics with the idea to control the power of management.},

High performance is achieved through fOllr lnechanisms, direction of attention and action, effort, persistence, and the development of task strategies and plans.

In a sample of 707 employees from 72 teams in Chinese enterprises, we tested the hypotheses using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM). The results suggest that leader work engagement is positively related to follower work engagement and that follower optimism significantly mediates the relationship. Moreover, follower self-efficacy strengthens the positive relationship between follower optimism and work engagement as well as the indirect effect of leader work engagement on follower work engagement via follower optimism.

Although the importance of positive feelings has been recognized through the years in the academic OB and popular literature, both management scholars and practitioners have arguably too often taken a negative perspective—trying to fix what is wrong with managers and employees and concentrating on weaknesses. Positive organizational behavior (POB) follows the lead of recently emerging positive psychology, which is driven by theory and research focusing on people's strengths and psychological capabilities. Instead of just retreading and putting a positive spin on traditional OB concepts, this unveiling of POB sets forth specific criteria for inclusion. Not only does positivity have to be associated with the concept, but it must also be relatively unique to the OB field, have valid measures, be adaptable to leader/management and human resource training and development, and, most important, capable of contributing to performance improvement in today's workplace. The criteria-meeting concepts of confidence/self-efficacy, hope, optimism, subjective well-being/happiness, and emotional intelligence (or the acronym CHOSE) are identified and analyzed as most representative of the proposed POB approach. The implications of these POB concepts for the workplace are given particular attention.},

Transformational leadership is the process whereby leaders engage and influence their followers toward attaining a shared vision through their capacity to inspire, innovate and personalize their attention. A between-subjects nonequivalent control group design was used to explore the impact of strength-based coaching on transformational and transactional leadership behaviors measured in a 360-degree feedback process. Thirty-seven executives and senior managers from a large not-for-profit organization were nonrandomly assigned to either a coaching or waitlist cohort. The coaching cohort received six sessions of leadership coaching involving feedback on leadership and strengths, goal setting, and strengths development. The coaching protocol was manualized to ensure some methodological consistency between the 11 executive coaches providing the intervention. This involved providing a written manual to each coach and coachee that outlined the required coaching process for each session. After six sessions of coaching over 3 months, cohorts then switched roles. The results showed that participants experienced highly statistically significant increases in their transformational leadership behavior after coaching and this difference was perceived at all levels within the organization but not by the participants themselves. Adherence to the strength-based protocol was also a significant predictor of ultimate degree of change in transformational leadership behavior. The results suggest that strength-based coaching may be effective in the development of transformational leaders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Explicating diversity within qualitative research is facilitated, initially, through documenting the range of qualitative data collection and analytic methods available. The authors then consider the notion of paradigmatic frame and review debates on the current and future positioning of qualitative research within psychological science. In so doing, the authors argue that the different ways in which the concept of paradigm can be interpreted allow them to challenge the idea that diverse research paradigms are prima facie incommensurate. Further, reviewing the ways in which proponents of qualitative research are seeking to reconfigure the links between paradigms helps the authors to envisage how communication between research communities can be enhanced. This critical review allows the authors to systematize possible configurations for research practice in psychology on a continuum of paradigm integration and to specify associated criteria for judging intermethod coherence.

It is not difficult to see which of these environments is more likely to encourage initiative, creativity and a willingness to put in extra effort, rather than simply counting down the hours to going-home time. Nor is it difficult to see which environment is more likely to attract and keep good employees. Laura lists the benefits of having a trusting manager and working in a progressive company. ‘There is flexibility that allows you to work in your most productive way,’ she says. ‘You may work better late at night or be working with business partners in another time zone. In my experience, more work gets done in a flexible workspace environment because I can take care of things like getting my car registered. I can work hours at home when I would normally be traveling to and from work. I can do focused work without the distractions that come with sitting at my cube, and I can be completely accessible for tasks that can be handled over email.’},

This recognition was accompanied by large-scale confrontation actions (in the form of mass protests) throughout the US. The current article uses the Confronting Prejudiced Responses (CPR) model to outline conditions that fostered White Americans’ shift in awareness surrounding racial inequity and the consequences of this perception change. Furthermore, we describe how reactions to confrontation efforts may depend on the messenger, message, modality and audience. Finally, we provide recommendations for individuals and organizations to support confrontation efforts aimed at reducing biased behavior and policies.},

This paper presents both the advantages of integrating quantitative information in qualitative data collection, analysis, and reporting, and the potential problems created by such uses and how these can be dealt with.

Applying Rousseau’s (1995, 2011) conceptualisation of psychological contracts it examines how the emotions linked to both promise perceptions (broken/exceeded) and regulation are made sense of in relation to perceptions of contract type. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes a unique perspective into the role perceptions of psychological contract type play in the process of emotional sensemaking using qualitative thematic analysis of 30 in-depth interviews. A range of occupations are represented and all participants worked in a full-time capacity. Findings The paper identifies how the predominant relationship frame (transactional/relational) is used by employees when making sense of the emotions recalled during specific psychological contract events, as well as the emotions they feel are necessary to regulate while at work. Research limitations/implications The mean age of the study sample was 26 years, comparatively young in terms of the span of the employment age bracket. Taking a lifespan approach would potentially broaden the understanding of how employees use their predominant relationship frame in the process of emotional sensemaking at different stages of their life and careers. Originality/value This paper identifies an important work-related cue used in the active regulation of specific emotions whilst at work, contributing to both the psychological contract and emotion literature.},

Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine whether the type of performance routine training could improve tenpin bowling accuracy and in-game performance. Design: A mixed-method design was adopted, whereby the impact of a performance routine intervention on performance accuracy and in-game performance was examined. This was followed by participants completing semi-structured interviews which explored the perceived effect of those routines. Method: Thirty-six experienced tenpin bowlers completed 30 accuracy shots pre- and post-intervention training, with league scores obtained for in-game performance comparison. Four groups (i.e., preperformance routine [PPR], post-performance routine [POST], combined pre-post routine, and a control group) practiced 12 games across four weeks while listening to the group specific routine instruction on an IPod. Results: It was noted that accuracy improved (albeit non-significantly) for the PPR and combined prepost routine group, but not the other groups. Critically, all intervention groups (PPR, POST \& COMBO) improved in-game performance. The qualitative data indicated that both the PPR and POST was perceived to influence positively performance, attentional and emotional control, self-awareness, selfconfidence, motivation. The PPR was also considered to enhance a state of readiness, and perceived control. Conclusions: Results indicate that the PPR training enhanced accuracy and in-game performance, with the POST training acting as a supportive role for in-game performance as evidenced by the qualitative and quantitative data. Future research should continue to investigate the effects of POSTs.},

  abstract = {Admittedly, the social exchange process is complex and there continues to be gaps in our understanding of how these processes play out in exchanges between organisations and their employees. Nevertheless, the principle of social exchange is sufficiently well established to serve as the basis for a number of theories relevant to the development and maintenance of psychological and behavioural engagement, including theories of perceived organisational support (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, \& Sowa, 1986), organisational justice (Greenberg, 1987), trust (Mayer, Davis, \& Schoorman, 1995), leader-member exchange (Liden, Sparrowe, \& Wayne, 1997), and psychological contracts ([Rousseau, D. M], 1995). Perceived organisational support, or the belief that the organisation values employees' contributions and is concerned about their well-being, has been found to be one of the best predictors of employees' affective organisational commitment ([John P. Meyer] et al., 2002), and to relate to a number of other indicators of psychological and behavioural engagement, including job satisfaction and organisational citizenship behaviour (Rhoades \& Eisenberger, 2002). Similarly, fairness in the distribution of resources (distributive justice), in the policies and procedures guiding distribution (procedural justice), and in the treatment of employees (interactional justice) have been shown to have moderate to strong relations with indices of both psychological and behavioural engagement (Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, \& Ng, 2001; Meyer et al., 2002). The same is true for perceptions of trust in management (Colquitt, Scott, \& LePine, 2007), quality of leader-member exchange (Dulebohn, Bommer, Liden, Brouer, \& Ferris, 2012), and the organisation's fulfillment/violation of the psychological contract with employees (Zhao, Wayne, Glibkowski, \& Bravo, 2010). In short, we have learned a great deal about the formation of employer-employee relationships and their implications for psychological and behavioural engagement. Like the principle of need satisfaction, the basic principle of social exchange and related theories can be used to explain the effects of many of the drivers of engagement discussed above. For example, empowering employees and providing effective leadership might be perceived as evidence of organisational support, and can also instill a sense of trust and justice. Such treatment should lead employees to reciprocate with increased commitment to organisational goals and exertion of discretionary effort toward their attainment. Social exchange principles can also explain variability in the engagement-relevant consequences of managerial interventions. For example, whether the introduction of an organisational change leads to an increase or decrease in psychological engagement might depend on whether it is viewed as consistent with or a violation of the psychological contract (Morrison \& Robinson, 1997). Importantly, these exchange-relevant principles can be used in analyses to assess the potential impact of managerial decisions even in the absence of concrete evidence pertaining to a specific intervention. When contemplating any intervention, managers can ask: "Will it be perceived by employees as evidence of the organisation's support?" "Will employees consider it to be fair?" "Is this decision consistent with or a violation of the psychological contract?" "Will it help to build or undermine trust?" If the answers are not immediately obvious to managers, they might be obtained in interviews or focus groups with employees.},

In this study, a three-week self-instructed online intervention which combines positive activities and mindfulness was developed and evaluated using a randomized-controlled group design with employees. All exercises could be easily integrated into the daily working routine. The intervention is based on broaden-and-build theory, the two-component model of mindfulness and the positive-activity model. Results indicate that the intervention is effective in increasing work engagement, hope and sleep quality as well as in reducing fatigue. Practical implications for human resource departments and corporate health management are discussed. Practitioner points A three-week mindfulness intervention can increase work engagement, hope, sleep quality, and reduce fatigue. Such activities can easily be integrated into the workday and thus, represent a realistic way for employees to improve motivation and reduce health impairment. \mbox},

The paper offers a model of training to help people and organizations to evolve.Findings– The paper describes what is missing in the employee contract – accountability on both sides. It explains what accountability means, why it is critical and how to start creating this in your organization.Practical implications– The paper argues that, if you want to have a successful employee‐engagement program, you have to start with employees who are engaged in their own life. Helping to grow people's self‐awareness and personal accountability is a good place to start. In this model of development, self‐awareness is defined as having a strong sense of yourself and the part you play in your world. It is the ability to respond in a positive and effective way to your environment. But the organization also has to step up and ensure all its behavior and actions are aligned with its stated values.Social implications– The paper contends that empowering people with these tools allows them to make more sense of their world, make better choices and to start living their best life. Business has the resources and organization to effect more than just economic growth.Originality/value– The paper advances the view that, with big questions being raised about the integrity of our most fundamental institutions, it is imperative that people's behavior be aligned with the values the organization espouses. If our state of being is not matched by our state of doing we court disaster.},

Moreover, we know that rates of bullying are particularly high in health care settings; however, we are less familiar with the factors that may reduce workplace bullying in hospitals. Thus, this study was conducted to determine whether the humor orientation styles of individuals, including nurses working in hospitals, as well as their managers? leadership styles, can influence perceptions of bullying in the workplace. Using data from 459 workers employed in a large hospital in the Southern United States, we examined associations between the Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale, which has four dimensions, as well as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, with three leadership substyles, and their associations with the risk of being bullied. We observed that one of the four humor subscales, Humor Appreciation, did affect perceptions of bullying in the workplace. The other three, Humor Recognition, Humor Production, and Humor for Coping, did not. However, the leadership styles of managers did affect reports of negative acts. In fact, transformational leadership was associated with 22\% of the variance in reports of decreased bullying activity. This work is consistent with previous work on the importance of leadership styles for creating positive work environments, particularly in hospital settings. Given these findings, we offer suggestions for leaders to further improve nursing communication.},

This statement implies that awareness motivates development and improves performance. This paper critically examines the introduction of 360° feedback in the civil service, drawing on the experiences of the Patent Office and taking account of the wider context of civil service modernisation. Design/methodology/approach – The case study gathered data through a series of interviews and questionnaires. It sought the perceptions and experiences of management and participants in relation to the implementation process and the outcomes of the scheme. Findings – At an organisational level the use of 360° feedback, as a performance management tool, failed to develop the self‐awareness anticipated. Neither was it found to be aligned with other development plans or the organisation's core competencies. At an individual level some participants believed that they achieved little from the process overall and this may be related to an expectation that the organisation's HRM system would be more proactive in planning development action on their behalf. Practical implications – This research reflects the situation in one organisation. It is argued that the findings will have relevance for the wider civil service as the agenda for organisational efficiency, target setting, and performance improvement gathers momentum. Originality/value – This paper takes a critical perspective on whether HR developments such as 360° feedback have a deep‐seated strategic rationale. It also explores the relationship between 360° feedback and the new public management.},

Design/methodology/approach A Delphi approach was used to gather commentary from 51 subject matter experts (SMXs) on factors that contribute to successful implementation of workplace bullying interventions. Findings A deductive approach to thematic analysis revealed that organisational infrastructure, commitment and engagement of management and competent and resourced professionals were the most consistently raised CSFs across interventions. These are broadly consistent with suggested implementation drivers previously recommended by researchers in the workplace bullying and implementation science fields. Research limitations/implications Two interventions did not receive adequate commentary meaning that key implementation drivers could not be sufficiently identified for them. While harnessing SMX commentary, the paper also develops a model of levels of evidence to guide future research. Practical implications This paper can assist organisations in planning and resourcing the implementation of workplace bullying interventions, to help ensure that interventions are as effective as possible.

We argue that, among others, insignificant validity is due to the broad and heterogeneous nature of the construct. In line with our hypotheses, we found internal structure of openness to be multidimensional. Further analyses on subdimensional and facet level revealed large differences in criterion- and construct-related validity. It could be demonstrated that a subdimension labeled epistemic curiosity and, especially, the facet openness to ideas, which includes aspects like curiosity, flexibility, willingness to learn, and creativity, are highly relevant for work-related criteria and so far understudied in organizational research.},

Considering manifold changes in the work environment as well as throughout an individual’s career, we review classic theories of career development in the beginning of this chapter. We then describe changes in today’s careers, and depict modern career theories, such as the protean or the boundaryless career. Subsequently, we elaborate on sources of change over the lifespan from an individual perspective: We explain how changes in personality, work values, or goal setting influence career development. From an organizational perspective, we describe how changes in the psychological contract or various age norms may influence the career development of employees. In the last part of this chapter, we outline central career developmental issues for individuals over the lifespan and point out recommendations for organizations in order to help promote meaningful, fulfilling, and sustainable career development over the lifespan.},

Design/methodology/approach – The study was conducted among employees of a Dutch branch of a large international organization which had survived a recent planned organizational change. In a survey, respondents were asked to report on their opinions about the organizational change at the time of the study, and retrospectively report on their opinions about the organizational change at the introduction of the organizational change. Findings – It was found that positive responses to the planned organizational change increased and negative responses decreased in the due course of the organizational change. In addition, survivors were ambivalent in their attitude towards the organizational change, as positive responses existed next to negative ones. With respect to the role of management communication it was found that satisfaction with management communication is most strongly related to responses to the organizational change as survivors who are satisfied with management communication score high on positive responses and low on negative responses. Research limitations/implications – The study has methodological limitations as it employs a one point in time measurement. Practical implications – This paper is a source for practitioners in the field of management communication as the results may guide them in focusing on maximizing employee satisfaction with management communication as this communication component is most strongly related to response to the organizational change. Originality/value – This paper provides empirical evidence of the value of management communication for survivors of organizational change processes.},

Since then, credence has generally been given to the view that favourable perceptions of major life-events may evoke different reactions to those viewed negatively. The original premise made no distinction between uplifts and downfalls, and viewed individuals as passsive homogeneous victims of life’s ‘slings and arrows’, without any volition to act on the environment which caused such hardship. Holmes \& Masuda (1974) developed this work further and constructed their ‘Schedule of Recent Experiences’ (SRE) which not only asked whether subjects had experienced a specific event, but also asked on how many occasions that event was experienced. The likelihood of more extreme events occurring on more than one occasion in the recent past are rare (e.g. death of a spouse). The underlying proposition behind this seminal work, that major changes in our daily lives are shown to increase the probability of illness, has yet to be effectively disconfirmed (Bhagat 1983, Billings \& Moos, 1982).},

Results of meta-analyses from more than 800 articles indicate that the relationships between chronological age and favorable attitudes (and/or to less unfavorable attitudes) toward work tasks, colleagues and supervisors, and organizations are generally significant and weak to moderate in strength. Moderator analyses also revealed that organizational tenure, race, gender, education level, and publication year of study moderate the relationships between age and job attitudes. Based on these findings, we make recommendations for future theory development and empirical research on age in organizational settings. We also discuss the implications of our findings for practice.},

A meta-analysis evaluated relations between the SDT-based constructs of practitioner support for patient autonomy and patients’ experience of psychological need satisfaction, as well as relations between these SDT constructs and indices of mental and physical health. Results showed the expected relations among the SDT variables, as well as positive relations of psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation to beneficial health outcomes. Several variables (e.g., participants’ age, study design) were tested as potential moderators when effect sizes were heterogeneous. Finally, we used path analyses of the meta-analyzed correlations to test the interrelations among the SDT variables. Results suggested that SDT is a viable conceptual framework to study antecedents and outcomes of motivation for health-related behaviors.},

Yet this practice is at odds with evidence that office workers' quality of life can be enriched by office landscaping that involves the use of plants that have no formal work-related function. To examine the impact of these competing approaches, 3 field experiments were conducted in large commercial offices in The Netherlands and the U.K. These examined the impact of lean and "green" offices on subjective perceptions of air quality, concentration, and workplace satisfaction as well as objective measures of productivity. Two studies were longitudinal, examining effects of interventions over subsequent weeks and months. In all 3 experiments enhanced outcomes were observed when offices were enriched by plants. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).},

Stressors were organizational constraints, interpersonal conflict, role conflict, role ambiguity, workload, work hours, and lack of control. The relationships between stressors and eight physical symptoms were quantitatively summarized and contrasted, for both individual symptoms and composite symptom scales. All of the occupational stressors were significantly related to physical symptoms in cross-sectional analyses, and the effect sizes of these relationships varied both by the stressor and the individual symptom examined. The longitudinal relationships were similar to the cross-sectional results, and provided some evidence of temporal consistency of the occupational stressorphysical symptom relationship. Organizational constraints and interpersonal conflict had the strongest relationships with symptoms in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Gastrointestinal problems and sleep disturbances were significantly related to more stressors than other symptoms examined. These findings show that it is important to examine physical symptoms, as they are related to a wide range of job stressors and these relationships prevail over time. Potential underlying mechanisms, including the immediacy of physiological reactions to stressors, participants’ attributions concerning stressor–physical symptom relationships, and the possible multidimensional nature of symptoms, are proposed and discussed.},

The scale converges appropriately with other prejudice measures and diverges from other social control measures (Study 2). It diverges from antiyouth ageism (Study 3). The Study 4 experiment yielded both predictive and divergent validity apropos another ageism measure. Structural equation modeling confirmed model fit across all studies. Per an intergenerational-tension focus, younger people consistently scored the highest.

Although widely cited, it is unclear as to the quantity of empirical evidence that supports this. A systematic review regarding the impact of exposure to natural environments on attention was conducted. Seven electronic databases were searched. Studies were included if (1) they were natural experiments, randomized investigations, or recorded ?before and after? measurements; (2) compared natural and nonnatural/other settings; and (3) used objective measures of attention. Screening of articles for inclusion, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by another. Where possible, random effects meta-analysis was used to pool effect sizes. Thirty-one studies were included. Meta-analyses provided some support for ART, with significant positive effects of exposure to natural environments for three measures (Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and Trail Making Test B). The remaining 10 meta-analyses did not show marked beneficial effects. Meta-analysis was limited by small numbers of investigations, small samples, heterogeneity in reporting of study quality indicators, and heterogeneity of outcomes. This review highlights the diversity of evidence around ART in terms of populations, study design, and outcomes. There is uncertainty regarding which aspects of attention may be affected by exposure to natural environments.},

A self-administered survey was applied to Kastamonu University academic and administrative personnel. A relevant data was collected from 118 personnel. The results of the study indicated that there were significant relationships between personality traits and job engagement. Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience were positively related but Neuroticism was negatively related to physical, emotional and cognitive engagement. Openness to Experience was the significant predictor of physical, emotional and cognitive engagement. Agreeableness was the predictor of emotional and cognitive engagement. As a higher order factor job engagement was related to big five factors. Openness to Experience and Agreeableness were the only significant predictors of job engagement. Results of this study suggest that the five factor model is useful for examining the dispositional source of job engagement.},

A legal requirement aimed at equipping national managers for eventual takeover of the management of industry from expatriates, the programme is analysed to ascertain the willingness to implement and the state of implementation by multinational companies operation in the industry. Design/methodology/approach The study employs critical discourse analysis (CDA), a problem-identification and problem-solving analytical tool to identify any obstacles suppressing the implementation and possible ways past the obstacles. Data for analysis were collected from 26 national managers from industry who were interviewed to gather views and expectations on their development. Findings Key findings include domination and hegemonic dynamics of expatriates through sustained power over the control of the MD process, CDA’s emancipatory power succeeds in identifying unrealised possibilities for tackling the MD problem for a social change (development of national managers) in industry, and non-implementation of the MD programme contributed by expatriates, the government of Ghana, and senior national managers. Social implications The programme has the potential of developing national managers for eventual takeover from expatriates, but requires implementing the law to the latter, including denying foreign subsidiaries mining lease if they fail to provide the adhere to localisation plans. Originality/value The paper extends literature on management of Western multinational subsidiaries in developing countries, revealing power and control over human resource practices, and MD in their foreign subsidiaries. It also contributes to literature on suppression of indigenous employees by other indigenous employees (the “colonised elites”), contrary to what is expected from indigenous people towards the development of their colleagues.},

  abstract = {This paper is written for individuals and organizations interested in systematically supporting the climate of civility, respect and engagement within their workplaces. We discuss an organization development program called Civility, Respect and Engagement at the Workplace (CREW), conducted at the national scale within the second largest government agency within the U.S.: the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is based on a process-focused, client-centered approach to organizational change (Reddy, 1994; Schein, 2006), with the intent of improving group members’ experience of their shared work environment. CREW facilitators support the group members’ dialogue about the meaning of civility within their particular group and about their personal interpretations of each other’s behaviors as civil or not. CREW proceeds for at least 6 months, using trained facilitators and a variety of supporting materials and activities from the centrally maintained toolkit that is freely shared by the designers of the program. CREW has been empirically demonstrated to improve civility in participating workgroups within and outside of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Levels of civility in general and participation in CREW specifically have been connected to positive outcomes for employees and organizations in prior research. This paper overviews the operating principles of CREW, describes the process of conducting the program and briefly summarizes the results available thus far. We offer enough detail to allow individuals and organizations to evaluate how this approach may benefit them and we share suggestions on where to start if there is interest in implementing the program.},

In Study 1, we report qualitative insights from 64 individuals about the experience and functioning of relational energy in the workplace. Study 2 draws from 3 employee samples to conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on a measure of relational energy, differentiating relational energy from related constructs. To test the predictive validity of the new relational energy scale, Study 3 comprises data from employees rating the level of relational energy they experienced during interactions with their leaders in a health services context. Results showed that relational energy employees experienced with their leaders at Time 1 predicted job engagement at Time 2 (1 month later), while controlling for the competing construct of perceived social support. Study 4 shows further differentiation of relational energy from leader-member exchange (LMX), replicates the positive relationship between relational energy (Time 1) and job engagement (Time 2), and shows that relational energy is positively associated with employee job performance (Time 3) through the mechanism of job engagement. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and highlight areas for future research.},

Here, we review how research on conformity and deviance can inform understanding of and effective responses to the pandemic. Group identities are critical for understanding who is influenced by whom, as well as how partisan divisions can obstruct cohesive and coordinated action. We identify several questions highlighted by the pandemic, including when people will react more harshly to ingroup members who violate health-protective norms (black sheep effect) or to outgroup members violating the same norms (intergroup hypocrisy). As a working hypothesis, we propose a goal-based approach, positing that differentially negative reactions to ingroup and outgroup deviants are likely influenced by the relative salience of goals to protect ingroup image, enforce group norms, maintain intergroup boundaries, and seek justice for potential victims put at risk by norm-violating behavior.},

Instrument contains fourteen items related with different dimensions of employee engagement. Data was collected thorough purposive sampling from 107 respondents on five point likert scale through questionnaire. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability of questionnaire was analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) version 16.0. Further Factor Analysis with varimax rotation using Kaiser Normalization was applied to the data which resulted in three factors. Findings of the study suggest that satisfactory work environment, opportunities to grow and job enrichment leads to higher engagement in employees belonging to fast growing industries like IT and Pharma. All respondent belong to age group of 20-40 and 90 \% of them are below 30. Which further suggest importance of these factors in engaging Gen X employees in these industries.},

We present a systematic review of research on academic scientists’ involvement in these activities to which we refer as ‘academic engagement’. Apart from extracting findings that are generalisable across studies, we ask how academic engagement differs from commercialisation, defined as intellectual property creation and academic entrepreneurship. We identify the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents and consequences of academic engagement, and then compare these findings with the antecedents and consequences of commercialisation. Apart from being more widely practiced, academic engagement is distinct from commercialisation in that it is closely aligned with traditional academic research activities, and pursued by academics to access resources supporting their research agendas. We conclude by identifying future research needs, opportunities for methodological improvement and policy interventions.},

It includes activities such as collaborative research with industry, contract research, consulting and informal ties. We consolidate what is known about the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents of academic engagement, and its consequences for research, commercialisation, and society at large. Our results suggest that individual characteristics associated with academic engagement include being scientifically productive, senior, male, locally trained, and commercially experienced. Academic engagement is also socially conditioned by peer effects and disciplinary characteristics. In terms of consequences, academic engagement is positively associated with academics’ subsequent scientific productivity. We propose new areas of investigation where evidence remains inconclusive, including individual life cycle effects, the role of organisational contexts and incentives, cross-national comparisons, and the impact of academic engagement on the quality of subsequent research as well as the educational, commercial and society-wide impact.},

In study 1 (N  227), the psychometric properties of the BarOn Emotional Quotient inventory were scrutinized through con®rmatory factor analysis and the measure was found to be unifactorial. When the EQ-i was examined concurrently with the Eysenck Personality Pro®ler, a clear trait EI factor emerged in Eysenckian factor space. In study 2 (N  166), a modi®ed version of the EQ-i was examined concurrently with the NEO PI-R and a truncated trait EI factor was isolated within the Five-Factor Model. Results are discussed with explicit reference to established personality models and it is concluded that trait EI can be conceptualized as a distinct composite construct at the primary level of hierarchical trait structures.

In study 2, trait EI scores from 102 persons were residualized on the Big Five and subsequently 15 high and 15 low trait EI individuals were selected to participate in a mood induction experiment.

Stress had a negative effect on satisfaction, which, in turn, had the strongest positive effect on commitment. There were many gender differences in the model, mainly concerning age, which was negatively related to control and commitment in the female sample only.

The inventory shows adequate reliability and temporal stability at the global, factor (4), and facet (15) levels. It has a clear and replicable factor structure comprising four distinct, but interrelated, dimensions: Emotionality, Self-control, Sociability, and Well-being. Self-other TEIQue correlations are substantial and similar to those observed for the Big Five. Preliminary data are presented for the new adolescent form of the TEIQue (TEIQue-AFF), which also shows satisfactory psychometric characteristics.},

We hypothesized and found that the combination of high day-level work pressure and high day-level autonomy (active jobs) was associated with higher day-level seeking resources and lower day-level reducing demands. Furthermore, we found that day-level seeking challenges (but not resources) was positively associated with day-level work engagement, whereas day-level reducing demands was negatively associated with day-level work engagement.

Results indicate that aspects of rater-ratee relationship quality (i.e., supervisor satisfaction, supervisor support, supervisor trust) are strongly related to ratee reactions to performance appraisals. Rater-ratee relationship quality is more strongly related to appraisal reactions than appraisal participation or performance ratings. Integrating social exchange theory with procedural justice theory, this article tested whether or not the relationship quality–appraisal reactions relationship was due to relationships between relationship quality and instrumental resources for the ratee (i.e., appraisal participation and rating favorability). When controlling for relationships between these resources and appraisal reactions, a direct path between relationship quality and reactions was significant, supporting a relational model of the exchange between appraisal partners. The relationship quality–appraisal reaction relationship was not moderated by performance rating favorability or appraisal participation. In total, these results highlight the importance of relationship quality to employee reactions to performance appraisal—and the importance of ratee reactions as an important resource in the social exchange between appraisal partners. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Grounded in socioemotional selectivity theory, the present study assesses how the effects of flexible schedules on sick day use, subjective health perceptions, work-to-family conflict, affective commitment, and work engagement change with age. The study uses 3,623 observations from the Linked Personnel Panel, a federally collected and maintained data set consisting of three waves from 2013–2017 in Germany. Results show that flexible schedules have age-specific effects for some outcomes and age-neutral effects for others. Flexible schedules were related to lower sick day use and higher subjective health perceptions only among older workers and reduced work-to-family conflict only among middle-aged workers. Relationships with work engagement and affective commitment were more consistently positive across age. The results point to the importance of understanding age-specific policy effects in the face of workforce aging. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Using 49,209 observations representing 183,454 employees in 22 different companies, we estimated a hierarchical linear model (HLM) to explain variation in employee engagement as a function of flexibility fit and age. Although flexibility fit was a powerful positive predictor of engagement for all employees, it was a more powerful predictor of engagement for employees ages 45 and older. The positive moderating effect of flexibility fit provides employers with guidance about how to maintain the engagement of workers of all ages, but especially older workers who want to extend their participation in the labor force.

We first consider several different viewpoints on the nature of communication in organizations. Then we turn to the structure of communication in organizations, particularly in terms of communication networks and their properties. Following this, we discuss different media of organizational communication and their impacts on the communication process. Taking these general concepts into account, the second major section of this chapter considers the state of current knowledge concerning six core organizational communication processes: (a) command, control, and coordination; (b) socialization, assimilation, and identification; (c) decision making; (d) participation, empowerment, and domination; (e) culture, community, and support; and (f) interorganizational communication. The role and function of communication in each of these core processes is discussed. Finally, in the conclusion, we touch briefly on general trends and future directions for the study of communication in organizations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

We examined data from participants (n\,=\,846) in a study in the Detroit, Michigan, area. Participants completed baseline interviews that assessed past-year stressful events and whether the participant had provided tangible assistance to friends or family members. Participant mortality and time to death was monitored for 5 years by way of newspaper obituaries and monthly state death-record tapes., Results. When we adjusted for age, baseline health and functioning, and key psychosocial variables, Cox proportional hazard models for mortality revealed a significant interaction between helping behavior and stressful events (hazard ratio [HR]\,=\,0.58; P\,{$<$}\,.05; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,0.35, 0.98). Specifically, stress did not predict mortality risk among individuals who provided help to others in the past year (HR\,=\,0.96; 95\% CI\,=\,0.79, 1.18), but stress did predict mortality among those who did not provide help to others (HR\,=\,1.30; P\,{$<$}\,.05; 95\% CI\,=\,1.05, 1.62)., Conclusions. Helping others predicted reduced mortality specifically by buffering the association between stress and mortality.},

Method In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 purposefully selected patients and analysed using components of both thematic analysis and grounded theory. Results Patients reported a desire to be independent, a poor therapeutic relationship and a loss of control due to medication effects as most important for disengagement.Time and commitment of staff, social support and engagement without a focus on medication, and a partnership model of the therapeutic relationship were most relevant for engagement. Conclusions The findings underline the importance of a comprehensive care model, committed staff with sufficient time, and a focus on relationship issues in dealing with‘difficultto engage’patients.},

Yet, the behaviors that PM is meant to achieve are in fact important drivers of engagement and performance. So where is the disconnect? The problem is that formal PM systems have reduced PM to intermittent steps and processes that are disconnected from day-to-day work and behaviors that actually drive performance: communicating ongoing expectations, providing informal feedback in real time, and developing employees through experience. To deliver on its promise, PM needs to shift from focusing on the formal system to focusing on the PM behaviors that matter every day. We describe a 5-step PM reform process that helps organizations achieve this change and that shows promise for increasing satisfaction and positive outcomes from PM processes. Central to the intervention is that organizational members need to intentionally practice and solidify effective PM behavior through a structured, on-the-job, experiential learning intervention that yields meaningful behavior change. The change-management and training interventions discussed here provide a model for organizational culture and behavior change efforts beyond PM.},

Design/methodology/approach – Using the theoretical framework of social information processing (SIP), the study investigated the communication processes in the social context, which contributed to employee cynicism toward organizational change in the higher education setting. Path analysis was used to test the overall model fit. Findings – The findings suggest that the three variables, perceived quality of information, cynicism of colleagues, and trust in the administration, predict change‐specific cynicism, which, in turn, lead to intention to resist change. Research limitations/implications – As an initial attempt to explain employee cynicism toward organizational change in higher education settings, this model inevitably has loose ends. Further research is needed to expand the model from a communication perspective. Practical implications – The research provided administrators with strategies and advices to cope with employee cynicism during organizational change. Originality/value – This is the first known study to examine the concept of change‐specific cynicism within the theoretical framework of SIP. It points to a new direction which warrants the attention of communication scholars.},

Results of a repeated cross-sectional study that collected individuals' perceptions of change one month prior to employee attitudes in consecutive years indicated that while the three change perceptions were moderately to strongly intercorrelated, the change perceptions displayed differential relationships with outcomes.

Moreover, traits matched to the task produced higher correlations with success, corrected r = .250, K = 42, N = 5607, than traits not matched to the task of running a business, corrected r = .028, K = 13, N = 2777. The traits matched to entrepreneurship significantly correlated with entrepreneurial behaviour (business creation, business success) were need for achievement, generalized self-efficacy, innovativeness, stress tolerance, need for autonomy, and proactive personality. These relationships were of moderate size in general and, moreover, heterogeneity suggested that future research should analyse moderator variables.},

The overall weighted effect size (Cohen’s d) for all studies was 0.526 (95\% confidence interval ϭ 0.364, 0.687), a significant medium to large effect. Interventions were coded as cognitive– behavioral, relaxation, organizational, multimodal, or alternative. Analyses based on these subgroups suggested that intervention type played a moderating role. Cognitive– behavioral programs consistently produced larger effects than other types of interventions, but if additional treatment components were added the effect was reduced. Within the sample of studies, relaxation interventions were most frequently used, and organizational interventions continued to be scarce. Effects were based mainly on psychological outcome variables, as opposed to physiological or organizational measures. The examination of additional moderators such as treatment length, outcome variable, and occupation did not reveal significant variations in effect size by intervention type.},

Results 23 randomised controlled trials were reviewed; two reported details of an economic evaluation. Eight trials reported effects in favour of stage based interventions, three trials showed mixed results, and 12 trials found no statistically significant differences between a stage based intervention and a non-stage based intervention or no intervention. Eleven trials compared a stage based intervention with a non-stage based intervention, and one reported statistically significant effects in favour of the stage based intervention. Two studies reported mixed effects, and eight trials reported no statistically significant differences between groups. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed, and few reported any validation of the instrument used to assess participants' stage of change. Overall, the evidence suggests that stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing smoking behaviour. Conclusions Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of stage based interventions in changing smoking behaviour.},

In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes.},

  abstract = {Over a decade of research attests to the importance of resilience in the workplace for employee well-being and performance. Yet, surprisingly, there has been no attempt to synthesize the evidence for the efficacy of resilience training in this context. The purpose of this study, therefore is to provide a systematic review of work-based resilience training interventions. Our review identified 14 studies that investigated the impact of resilience training on personal resilience and four broad categories of dependent variables: (1) mental health and subjective well-being outcomes, (2) psychosocial outcomes, (3) physical/biological outcomes, and (4) performance outcomes. Findings indicated that resilience training can improve personal resilience and is a useful means of developing mental health and subjective well-being in employees. We also found that resilience training has a number of wider benefits that include enhanced psychosocial functioning and improved performance. Due to the lack of coherence in design and implementation, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the most effective content and format of resilience training. Therefore, going forward, it is vital that future research uses comparative designs to assess the utility of different training regimes, explores whether some people might benefit more/less from resilience training, and demonstrates consistency in terms of how resilience is defined, conceptualized, developed, and assessed. Practitioner points Despite conceptual and theoretical support for resilience training, the empirical evidence is tentative, with the exception of a large effect for mental health and subjective well-being outcomes. Most programmes utilize a cognitive-behavioural approach to developing resilience. At this stage, there is no definitive evidence for the most effective training content or format, but it would appear wise to include an element of one-to-one training and support based on individual needs.},

Interviews were analyzed using constant comparison. Living with ambiguity of mental illness was the central concern. The basic social process was pursuing normalcy and included confronting the ambiguity of mental illness, seeking to control impact of the illness, and seeing possibilities for the future. Goals were managing crises, containing and controlling symptoms, and crafting a notion of “normal.” Strategies were being vigilant, setting limits on patients, invoking logic, dealing with sense of loss, seeing patients’ strengths, and taking on roles. The study revealed that families were profoundly affected by the social contexts of mental illnesses.},

  abstract = {Research and theory support the notion that flexible work arrangements (i.e., job resources in the form of formal policies that allow employees the latitude to manage when, where, and how they work) can have a positive influence on various outcomes that are valued both by organizations and their constituents. In the present study, we integrate propositions from various theoretical perspectives to investigate how flexible work arrangements influence work engagement. Then, in 2 studies we test this association and model the influence of different conceptualizations of health and age as joint moderators of this relationship. Study 1 focuses on functional health and chronological age in an age-diverse sample, whereas study 2 focuses on health symptom severity and subjective age in a sample of older workers. In both studies, we demonstrate that the influence of flexible work arrangements on work engagement is contingent upon age and health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Recent research highlighting the role of ideologies and worldviews in shaping science skepticism can inform research questions as well as pandemic responses to COVID-19. It is likely that the antecedents of general COVID-19-related skepticism substantially overlap with the antecedents of climate change skepticism. Additionally, skepticism about a potential vaccine in particular will likely be fueled by similar worries and misperceptions to those shaping more general antivaccination attitudes, of which conspiracy thinking is particularly worth highlighting. We conclude by reflecting on how the COVID-19 crisis may shape future social-psychological research aimed at understanding trust in science and science skepticism.},

Until now the focus has been on approaches to classifying intervention strategies, the appropriateness of mediation as an intervention strategy and ways different organizations respond to workplace bullying. This study prefers a qualitative design and employs a new empirical approach. Consultants who have specialized in bullying consultation were interviewed and asked which intervention strategies they apply and for what reason and to what purpose the strategies are adopted. It is found that consultants apply conflict moderation or mediation, coaching, and/or organization development. This is interesting as the dominating contingency approach to conflict intervention (Fisher \& Keasly, 1990; Glasl, 1982; Prein, 1984) recommends neither coaching nor organization development. Based on Heames and Harvey's (2006) multilevel model of bullying, this article therefore suggests a new approach, a multilevel approach of interventions in workplace bullying that considers interventions at the dyadic, group and organizational level.},

However, employee engagement has rarely been studied in the academic literature and relatively little is known about its antecedents and consequences. The purpose of this study was to test a model of the antecedents and consequences of job and organization engagements based on social exchange theory. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was completed by 102 employees working in a variety of jobs and organizations. The average age was 34 and 60 percent were female. Participants had been in their current job for an average of four years, in their organization an average of five years, and had on average 12 years of work experience. The survey included measures of job and organization engagement as well as the antecedents and consequences of engagement. Findings – Results indicate that there is a meaningful difference between job and organization engagements and that perceived organizational support predicts both job and organization engagement; job characteristics predicts job engagement; and procedural justice predicts organization engagement. In addition, job and organization engagement mediated the relationships between the antecedents and job satisfaction, organizational commitment, intentions to quit, and organizational citizenship behavior. Originality/value – This is the first study to make a distinction between job and organization engagement and to measure a variety of antecedents and consequences of job and organization engagement. As a result, this study addresses concerns about that lack of academic research on employee engagement and speculation that it might just be the latest management fad.},

The data were obtained from 150 training professionals who were members of a training and development association in Canada. The results indicated that training evaluation frequency is positively related to training transfer. However, among Kirkpatrick's four levels of evaluation criteria, only behavior and results criteria were related to higher rates of transfer of training, indicating that the level of evaluation criteria is important for training transfer. These results indicate the importance of organizational-level initiatives such as training evaluation in addition to individual-level practices for facilitating the transfer of training.},

In this article, we review these concerns as well as research in an attempt to determine what we have learned about employee engagement. We then offer a theory of employee engagement that reconciles and integrates Kahn's () theory of engagement and the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) model (Bakker \& Demerouti, ). We conclude that there continues to be a lack of consensus on the meaning of employee engagement as well as concerns about the validity of the most popular measure of employee engagement. Furthermore, it is difficult to make causal conclusions about the antecedents and consequences of employee engagement due to a number of research limitations. Thus, there remain many unanswered questions and much more to do if we are to develop a science and theory of employee engagement.},

Furthermore, customers (N ϭ 1,140) from these units provided information on employee performance and customer loyalty. Structural equation modeling analyses were consistent with a full mediation model in which organizational resources and work engagement predict service climate, which in turn predicts employee performance and then customer loyalty.

  abstract = {Purpose – Management attempts to transform organizations seldom succeed. This paper aims to describe seven common communication behaviors accompanying those failures. Design/methodology/approach – This paper integrates material from three recent communication and organizational change studies, recent change theory, and complexity theory to model communication and change processes. All the studies employed traditional ethnographic methods, but one study employed quantitative methods as well as part of a mixed methods design. Findings – Data describe six common communication behaviors during failed organizational change efforts. The combination of these behaviors suggests a seventh pattern. Communication during failed efforts seldom involves enough communication opportunities, lacks any sense of emerging identification, engenders distrust, and lacks productive humor. These problems are compounded by conflict avoidance and a lack of interpersonal communication skills. Members decouple the system, sheltering the existing culture until it is safe for it to reemerge later. Research limitations/implications – The integration of data from three studies with theory improves transferability, but more studies would improve the veracity of the results. Only one study employed quantitative data along with qualitative data. Organizational change research may need to employ mixed methods and augment results through simulations to understand time‐dependent processes. Practical implications – Results point to the limitations of management and impersonal communication. Change is a messy business, and transformational change will not happen unless management is willing to tolerate the ambiguity and the sense that emerges in communication. Results also point to the importance of communication skills in hiring practices. Originality/value – Few essays integrate results from several studies. This paper challenges accepted management practices and extends the growing understanding of the limits of individuals to control social change; it also adds to the literature on and application of complexity theory.},

The findings in reports of qualitative health research are too often difficult to understand and even to find owing to the way they are presented. A basic strategy for enhancing the presentation of these findings is to translate them into thematic statements, which can then in turn be translated into the language of intervention and implementation.

Alternatively, lower power groups were predicted to fit and be more valued by those individuals with a prevention focus because these groups necessitate (and thus sustain) a focus on safety and security. Five studies found support for these predictions by both assessing and manipulating regulatory focus and group power and by using explicit and implicit measures of group attraction. Moreover, these regulatory fit effects occurred specifically for group power and not for general differences in group status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Simultaneous confirmatory factor analyses in both samples confirmed the original three-factor structure of the MBI-GS (exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy) as well as the hypothesized three-factor structure of engagement (vigor, dedication, and absorption). Contrary to expectations, a model with two higher-order factors – ‘burnout’ and ‘engagement’ – did not show a superior fit to the data. Instead, our analyses revealed an alternative model with two latent factors including: (1) exhaustion and cynicism (‘core of burnout’); (2) all three engagement scales plus efficacy. Both latent factors are negatively related and share between 22\% and 38\% of their variances in both samples. Despite the fact that slightly different versions of the MBI-GS and the engagement questionnaire had to be used in both samples the results were remarkably similar across samples, which illustrates the robustness of our findings.},

Results confirm the hypothesized model indicating that: (1) burnout and engagement are negatively related, sharing between 10 per cent and 25 per cent of their variances; (2) burnout is mainly predicted by job demands but also by lack of job resources, whereas engagement is exclusively predicted by available job resources; (3) burnout is related to health problems as well as to turnover intention, whereas engagement is related only to the latter; (4) burnout mediates the relationship between job demands and health problems, whereas engagement mediates the relationship between job resources and turnover intention. The fact that burnout and engagement exhibit different patterns of possible causes and consequences implies that different intervention strategies should be used when burnout is to be reduced or engagement is to be enhanced.

  abstract = {Affective experiences at work are a key contributing factor to long-term job-related well-being and effectiveness, yet may systematically change as workers get older. Given the central role of affect in work settings, it is important to obtain a thorough understanding of older workers’ strengths and vulnerabilities in affective functioning. This paper’s goal was to comprehensively study age differences in mean levels and dynamics of affect (affect stability, occurrence of positive and negative daily work events, and affective reactivity) and to link these with perceptions of global occupational well-being and effectiveness. In three diary studies, employees of different occupational and cultural backgrounds (Hong Kong Chinese managerial employees, German hospital employees, German office workers) reported daily affective work events and affect across multiple workdays. Higher age was associated with more positive and less negative affect (Study 1), more frequent positive daily work events (Study 2 and 3), and lower variability of negative affect (Study 1 and 2). Age was unrelated to frequency of negative work events and positive event reactivity (all studies). There were mixed age differences in negative event reactivity (lower reactivity in Study 1 and on subtypes of affect in Study 2, but higher worry in Study 3). Several of the indicators of affective experience emerged as mediators of positive age differences in work engagement and self-rated task performance. Overall, with one exception, results point at maintenance or improvement of workers’ affective functioning with age. Through improved affective functioning, older workers likely contribute to organizational effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Concepts for understanding culture in organizations have value only when they derive from observation of real behavior in organizations, when they make sense of organizational data, and when they are definable enough to generate further study. The attempt to explain what happened to "brainwashed" American prisoners of war in the Korean conflict points up the need to take both individual traits and culture into account to understand organizational phenomena. For example, the failure of organizational learning can be understood more readily by examining the typical responses to change by members of several broad occupational cultures in an organization. The implication is that culture needs to be observed, more than measured, if organization studies is to advance.},

Two central themes were identified: (a) navigating two world views which referred to acculturation as a fluid process where athletes navigated between cultural norms of the home community and the host community, and (b) acculturation loads, which referred to whether immigrants and those in the host country shared acculturation (i.e., acculturation as a two-way process) or managed the load with or without support from others (i.e., acculturation as one-directional). Each of these central themes comprised sub-themes, which provided further insight into the experiences of acculturation for immigrant elite athletes. From the project, the authors recommend further research utilising case studies to provide a holistic description of the acculturation process from the vantage of various people within the sport context.},

They argue that highly reflexive teams will be more innovative than teams low in reflexivity when facing a demanding work environment. A field study of 98 primary health care teams in the United Kingdom corroborated their predictions: Team reflexivity was positively related to team innovation, and team reflexivity and work demands interacted such that high levels of both predicted higher levels of team innovation. Furthermore, an interaction between team reflexivity, quality of physical work environment (PWE), and team innovation showed that poor PWE coupled with high team reflexivity was associated with higher levels of team innovation. These results are discussed in the context of the need for team reflexivity and team innovation among teams at work facing high levels of work demands.},

We distinguish 4 main periods: the pre-1971 era, with pioneering work on exploring conceptualization and operationalizations of the climate construct; the 1971–1985 era, with foundational work on aggregation issues, outcome-focused climates (on safety and service) and early writings on culture; the 1986–1999 era, characterized by solidification of a focused climate approach to understanding organizational processes (justice, discrimination) and outcomes (safety, service) and the beginnings of survey approaches to culture; and the 2000–2014 era, characterized by multilevel work on climate, climate strength, demonstrated validity for a climate approach to outcomes and processes, and the relationship between leadership and climate and culture. We summarize and comment on the major theory and research achievements in each period, showing trends observed in the literature and how JAP has contributed greatly to moving research on these constructs, especially climate, forward. We also recommend directions for future research given the current state of knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

The study was carried out among 1,964 Finnish dentists over a seven-year time period (2003–2010), using a three-wave dataset. Some of the dentists had changed jobs during the follow-up, and therefore the research questions were validated among groups of job stayers and job changers. The stability and change models were examined using structural equation modelling. The results showed that 69–77\% of the variance of dentists’ work engagement, and 46–49\% of the variance of job resources was explained by the component reflecting stability. However, although there was a positive relationship between job resources and work engagement, the primary direction of this relationship could not be determined. Either job resources or work engagement may be considered as the initiator of this relationship. Job change did not affect the results.},

In this paper we explore one important solution to overcoming the lack of employee engagement: leadership. First, we provide an in-depth review of the extant multiple conceptualizations of employee engagement in the academic literature and related research. To increase the applicability of these multiple definitions for practitioners, we offer a coalesced definition of employee engagement with 2 factors: energy and involvement. Finally, after introducing the importance of leadership, we integrate existing theory and research to identify and describe 4 pathways for increasing energy and involvement, which leaders can leverage for impact on employee, unit, and organizational level work outcomes.

Seeking internal replication, we tested our models twice, both during T1-T2 and during T2-T3. We also examined whether any Personality × Attainment moderator effects upon change in SWB at T2 still persisted at T3. Grit was the only candidate strength that predicted increased goal attainment from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3, and Curiosity was the only candidate strength that moderated attainment effects on well-being from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3. T2 Goal attainment effects on SWB were best sustained at T3 when Meaning Orientation increased from T1 to T2.

Indeed, significant differences in work-life perspectives and needs were observed with workers at different life stages. Similarities were also apparent, particularly with regard to work demands and flexibility. It was clear that existing organisational policies (and culture) do not meet the needs of workers across the life course. This was linked to reduced work hours and turnover intentions. Implications for organisational policies and practices are discussed, with a focus on access to part-time and flexible work.},

  abstract = {Meta-analytic findings suggest that strongly enforcing ethical codes of conduct reduces unethical behaviour. However, this conclusion is based on a limited number of studies, leading ethics scholars to suggest that we need to know more about the effects of codes. Furthermore, the importance of understanding how individual differences may interact with situational characteristics to influence unethical behaviour has long been recognized, but few studies have examined both personal and situational variables. Using norm focus theory as an organizing framework, the authors argue that enforcement of an ethical code of conduct and individual-level conscientiousness interacts to influence unethical behaviour. In Study 1, participants attended a laboratory session in which a code of conduct was presented and the participants had the opportunity to earn additional compensation if they acted unethically. Participants engaged in less unethical behaviour after they observed strict enforcement, but this was qualified by an enforcement x conscientiousness interaction: Strict enforcement led to lower unethical behaviour only among those who were more conscientious. In Study 2, a survey of working adults showed that the relation between code enforcement and unethical behaviour was mediated by a focus on injunctive norms, but only among those who were more conscientious. The findings therefore indicate that there are important boundary conditions on the effects of codes of conduct. Practitioner points When people are aware of a code of conduct, but have no information about how strongly the code of conduct is enforced, they view enforcement as similar to a situation wherein they witness weak enforcement. Strongly enforced codes of conduct serve to (1) increase the importance of avoiding unethical behaviour, and (2) reduce the magnitude of unethical behaviour, but only among those who are more conscientiousness. To ensure reduction of unethical behaviour, organizations must strongly enforce codes and select employees who are highly conscientious. Alternatively, organizations may test different methods of enforcement to identify those that are effective in reducing unethical behaviour regardless of how conscientious employees are.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how age norms influence the relationship between individual differences, job attitudes, and intentions to pursue career transitions for midlife adults (aged 35 and above). The authors hypothesized that the effects of individual difference variables (i.e. resilience and reframing abilities) on career change intentions in addition to the effects of job attitude (i.e. commitment) on such intentions are moderated by career youth norms (CYN) which the authors defined as perceptions that the typical worker in a career field is younger than midlife. Design/methodology/approach In all, 206 people comprised the sample which was derived from an online survey. Moderated regression analysis was used to assess the extent to which age norms operated as a moderator of proposed relationships. Control variables were included based on prior research findings. Findings Findings demonstrated that age norms operate as a significant moderator for midlife adults. Specifically, the relationships between resilience, reframing, and commitment on intentions to pursue alternative careers are moderated by CYNs. Research limitations/implications Data were collected from a single source and assessed behavioral intentions in place of actual career change choice. Future research should derive data from multiple sources and assess behavior beyond intentions. Practical implications Industry leaders’ stereotypes about the appropriate ages for specific occupations or professions may impact the psychological mobility of midlife workers. Managers may wish to highlight midlife workers with particular skills (e.g. technological savvy), examine recruitment advertising for language that emphasizes youth, and invest in resilience training for aging workers. Originality/value Research examining careers at midlife and beyond has extensively discussed age discrimination and stereotypes as potential barriers to professional or occupational change. However, few studies have investigated how age norms and the comparisons people make between themselves and those they believe are occupying the jobs they desire may also pose barriers to career transition.},

The study is idiographic and primarily qualitative and is grounded in the detailed case-studies of individual women going through the transition, prioritizing their own accounts of the experience. The study employs an interpretative phenomenological analysis of interviews, diaries and repertoy grids. The paper presents a processual model of the transition. Key components of the model attend to the women’s perception of their social roles. It suggests that during pregnancy a woman’s focus may turn from the public world of work towards the more local world of family and friends. This shift may help with the woman’s preparation for the new role she is taking on and may furthermore contribute to a transformation of the woman’s subsequent life plans. Examples from the women’s accounts illustrate each component of the model. The theoretical model is then discussed in relation to the existing literature.},

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six patients and the resultant transcripts subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. The analysis points to the powerful ways in which chronic pain has negative impact on patients’ self and identity. This impact is made worse in the public arena. Some of the participants describe how the ensuing derogatory self image also seems to lead to their directing negative affect towards other people. The results section gives a detailed account of these processes at work. The results are then considered in relation to relevant constructs in the extant literature, including work on illness and identity, shame and acceptance.},

One of the most influential and well-known models is the demand-control theory. The model was developed by Karasek (1979), who proposed that the joint effects of ‘demands’ and the ‘range of decision-making freedom available to the worker’ (i.e. job control) were important in predicting strain outcomes. A key aspect of the model is the interactive relationship between job demands and job control. Karasek \& Theorell (1990) argue that the risk of psychological strain and physical illness increases in a demanding job only when these demands occur in interaction with low job control.},

One of the basic issues of concern to organizational researchers is the health and well-being of employees, and it has been viewed as both a response to the work environment and as an affect-related antecedent of other employee outcomes such as job performance or turnover. Employee control beliefs and perceptions have been linked to well-being and play an important role (Ganster and Fusilier, 1989; Spector, 1982). Although there is a tremendous amount of research at the individual level relating control and other variables to well-being, most has been done in the USA and a handful of western nations, and most has targeted the individual employee. Our study compared managers from 24 nations/territories at the ecological or sample mean level (Leung and Bond, 1989), as opposed to the individual participant level, in order to draw more definitive conclusions about nation differences.},

Design/methodology/approach – The general approach is one of conceptual transfer: to cast work psychological phenomena in lifespan psychological terms to generate the tenets. Findings – Rather than declining uniformly, older workers' motivation develops in a multidirectional, multilevel way. Motivation decline in certain types of work tasks goes with stable motivation and even motivation gains in other tasks as a function of a variety of task characteristics. These age‐related changes may be captured in a worker's motivation profile, which is functional for positive affect regulation. Practical implications – The conceptualisation suggests a more differentiated approach to job design and human resource management, considering age‐related changes at multiple levels simultaneously instead of focusing on major age effects only. Originality/value – The conceptual clarity of work motivation research is enhanced by distinguishing global and task‐specific levels of motivation that may dissociate in older workers. By transferring up‐to‐date findings and concepts from Lifespan Psychology to Organisational Psychology, further research is stipulated in both fields.},

Design/methodology/approach The most important contributions to this stream of research have been case studies of organizations struggling to survive serious crises. Findings Very diverse kinds of organizations run into serious crises, and many organizations fail because they respond poorly or slowly to these crises. Slow and inadequate initial responses result in organizations going into a stage of “unlearning” that is demoralizing, harmful and very difficult to manage. Research limitations/implications The research involved a small number of longitudinal case studies. Practical implications Organizations may survive longer if they deal with serious crises more effectively. Top management teams especially may benefit from discussing how to spot and mitigate crises. The paper proposes a few actions that organizations might usefully take before and after trouble becomes visible. Social implications Almost all organizations have short lives, and many organizations fail when they encounter unexpected, serious crises. The consequences include unemployment, dislocation, emotional turmoil, wasted resources and cynicism. Originality/value This paper reviews published research. Its value depends on the plausibility of its interpretations and the practical usefulness of the advice offered.},

  abstract = {Research on learning has primarily focused on the role of doing (experience) in fostering progress over time. Drawing on literature in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, we propose that one of the critical components of learning is reflection, or the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the key lessons taught by experience. In particular, we argue that purposeful reflection on one’s accumulated experience leads to greater learning than the accumulation of additional experience. We explain this boost in learning through self-efficacy: reflection builds confidence in the ability to achieve a goal, which in turn translates into higher rates of learning. We test the resulting model experimentally, using a mixed-method design that combines two laboratory experiments with a field experiment conducted in a large businessprocess outsourcing company in India. We find that individuals who are given time to reflect on a task improve their performance at a greater rate than those who are given the same amount of time to practice with the same task. Our results also show that if individuals themselves are given the choice to either reflect or practice, they prefer to allocate their time to gaining more experience with the task– to the detriment of their learning.},

Background Bullying is a serious problem in workplaces with consequences for the individual, the organisation and the quality of care. Method Open-ended interviews were conducted with 12 participants, including managers and specialists within one hospital and three municipalities. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. Results Bullying was often concealed, due to avoidance, unclear definition and lack of direct strategies against bullying. No preventative work focusing on bullying existed. Psychosocial issues were not prioritized at workplace meetings. The supervisor had the formal responsibility to identify, manage and solve the bullying problem. The most common decision to solve the problem was to split the group. Conclusions The findings showed that bullying was a concealed problem and was first acknowledged when the problem was acute. Implications for Nursing Management Crucial strategies to prevent and combat bullying consist of acknowledgement of the problem, transformational leadership, prioritization of psycho-social issues, support of a humanistic value system and work through bullying problems to achieve long-term changes.},

Indeed, two higher-order factors, and also one General Factor of Personality (GFP), have been found in many studies in data collected by using instruments intended to measure the Big Five in the FiveFactor Model (FFM) framework. To date, however, there is a lack of studies that apply the methodology for identifying higher-order factors of the Big Five/FFM to the Big Six/HEXACO model, even though the latter is currently deemed a serious alternative to the former. The goal of the presented studies was to fill this gap. Namely, we tested whether similar higher-order factors to those identified above the Big Five/FFM can be found above the Big Six/HEXACO basic personality traits by applying analytical methods elaborated within the Big Five/FFM framework. We conducted two studies: one with 805 participants, and another with 502 respondents, using three different Big Six/HEXACO measures and three Big Five/FFM measures. The obtained results suggest the existence of two higher-order factors in the Big Six/HEXACO, similar to those found in the Big Five/FFM, and indicate no presence of the GFP in the former.},

However, there are many of us who also live with the nagging doubt, suspicion and fear that ‘it’ is not performing as well as it might or, indeed, maximizing its full potential. Thus, we conclude that ‘it’ needs fixing in some way. The ‘it’ referred to in this context is, of course, business success and effectiveness. In particular, the concern is for the health and performance of the organization. Therefore, this book addresses the ways in which we can maximize performance and health in the workplace by using an integrated, organizational strategy for the management of stress. It differs from other traditional stress management books in three main ways.},

  abstract = {We have argued for an organizational approach to the management of stress, but also acknowledge that a successful stress management package will need to operate from more than one level. Indeed, a number of stress researchers have pointed out that stress control can be successful only if it is tackled at the level of the individual and the organization (DeFrank and Cooper, 1987; Hart, 1987). Therefore, We should operate at an organizational level to prevent or limit stress where this is a possible and reasonably practicable solution (Elkin and Rosch, 1990). We can work with individuals, teams or groups, to educate and train employees to cope more effectively with sources of stress that can not be removed from the job. However, we need to ensure that the weaknesses of this approach are overcome. We must also have in place strategies to deal with employees who ‘fall through the net’ to become victims of exposure to stress, since no organizational intervention is likely to be perfect or foolproof. Individuals are complex and unique and so they vary in their response to stress. Therefore, a stress management solution for one individual will not suit all employees or occupational groups.},

To achieve this we have examined the stress process, explained its origins, provided definitions of stress, and a model of stress to guide the process of analysis. In order to complete the process of ANALYSIS, a means of identification and measurement of stress at work has been described. This is the ‘stress audit’. The objective of this type of psychological risk assessment is to enable the organization to optimize the performance and health of the workforce. This is achieved by eliminating or minimizing sources of stress that are damaging in their consequences. Thereby we are acknowledging the maxim ‘healthy work force — healthy organization’(Davies and Teasdale, 1994). In this instance, we use the word ‘health’ in its widest sense, to mean not just the absence of physical and psychological diseases, but to describe feelings of well being, happiness, and satisfaction. Indeed, it is about obtaining a ‘good quality of life’. Research findings highlight the nature of stress in the workplace in terms of potential ‘hot spot’ issues. Thus, the steps described so far are necessary to guide and inform the ACTION phase of the stress management process. This is the final ‘A’ in our triple A approach to stress management. ‘Action’ is the subject of our final chapter.},

Neither demographic variables (sex, ethnicity, education, and secular trends), nor the standing on the five major dimensions of personality, were predictors of change in trait stability.

We address the question whether coaching has an effect on five both theoretically and practically relevant individual-level outcome categories: performance/skills, well-being, coping, work attitudes, and goal-directed self-regulation. The results show that coaching has significant positive effects on all outcomes with effect sizes ranging from g = 0.43 (coping) to g = 0.74 (goal-directed self-regulation).

Our goal was to contribute to current understanding by considering the moderating role of distributive justice in the relation between financial incentives, motivation, and performance. Based on self-determination theory, we hypothesized that when bonuses are fairly distributed, using financial incentives makes employees feel more competent and autonomous, which in turn fosters greater autonomous motivation and lower controlled motivation, and better work performance. Results from path analyses in three samples supported our hypotheses, suggesting that the effect of financial incentives is contextual, and that compensation plans using financial incentives and bonuses can be effective when properly managed.

In this paper, we developed a more comprehensive definition of bullying bystanders, and examined first person accounts from healthcare professionals who had been bystanders to workplace bullying. These perspectives highlighted factors that influence the type and the extent of support bystanders may offer to targets. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 43 healthcare professionals who were working in the UK, of which 24 had directly witnessed bullying. The data were transcribed and analysed using Thematic Analysis. The analysis identified four themes that describe factors that influence the type and extent of support bystanders offer to targets of bullying: (a) the negative impact of witnessing bullying on bystanders, (b) perceptions of target responsibility, (c) fear of repercussions, and (d) bystander awareness. Our findings illustrate that, within the healthcare setting, bystanders face multiple barriers to offering support to targets and these factors need to be considered in the wider context of implementing bystander interventions in healthcare settings.},

This study explains in detail the concepts of satisfaction and delight; their antecedents and potential outcomes.Design/methodology/approach– An extensive review of existing customer delight literature reveals the key concepts necessary for customer delight to occur.Findings– Customer delight is a better measure of customer relationship management than customer satisfaction. Delight is likely to generate positive business results such as word‐of‐mouth communications, loyalty and increased profitability. Using existing literature a model is developed.Practical implications– The proposed model can be used by managers to achieve customer delight in their organizations. It can also be used to gain a better understanding of the process of managing customer relations.Originality/value– In the last few years the concept of customer delight has been taking precedence over the concept of satisfaction. Despite such emphasis, there are few published articles relating to this topic in the hotel industry. The study uses customer delight literature from various industries and attempts to apply such knowledge to the hospitality industry.},

Second, its factorial structure and psychometric properties were assessed. Two samples of workers (military: N ϭ 465; civilians: N ϭ 192) voluntarily completed questionnaires. Using the WEIMS’s 3 indexes (work self-determination index, work self-determined and nonself-determined motivation, respectively), results of regression analyses were supportive of its ability to predict positive and negative criteria in the workplace. Results also showed the adequacy of both its construct validity and internal consistency. Its factorial structure was also invariant across samples. Finally, its quasi-simplex pattern and relationships with psychological correlates further supported the self-determination continuum. Overall, these findings provide evidence for the applicability as well as the reliability and validity of the WEIMS in organisational settings. Results are discussed in regard to the applicability of self-determination theory to the workplace.},

We present a novel approach to examine the role of stereotypes in predicting self-rated leadership potential across gender and age groups. This research sheds light on the impact of leadership-incongruent and detrimental stereotypes about one’s gender and age, for women and older workers, on self-ratings of leadership potential. Across three studies (total N = 640), correlational and experimental evidence shows differential effects of stereotypes about women (vs. men) and older (vs. younger) people on self-ratings of their own leadership potential. Specifically, results suggest that both gender and age stereotypes affect older workers more than their younger counterparts (Study 1). We examined the effects of stereotyped workplace cultures and found comparable effects on self-rated leadership potential at the intersectional level, with women self-rating more leadership potential than men in the younger but not the older age group (Study 2). Furthermore, stereotyped workplace cultures impacted women’s and older worker’s perceptions of job fit (Studies 2 \& 3), also extending to job appeal for older workers (Study 3). Results are discussed in terms of career implications for both women and older workers, with a particular focus on older women, whose intersecting identities are leadership stereotype-incongruent.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to organizational change have been dominated by assumptions privileging stability, routine, and order. As a result, organizational change has been reified and treated as exceptional rather than natural. In this paper, we set out to offer an account of organizational change on its own terms—to treat change as the normal condition of organizational life. The central question we address is as follows: What must organization(s) be like if change is constitutive of reality? Wishing to highlight the pervasiveness of change in organizations, we talk about organizational becoming. Change, we argue, is the reweaving of actors' webs of beliefs and habits of action to accommodate new experiences obtained through interactions. Insofar as this is an ongoing process, that is to the extent actors try to make sense of and act coherently in the world, change is inherent in human action, and organizations are sites of continuously evolving human action. In this view, organization is a secondary accomplishment, in a double sense. Firstly, organization is the attempt to order the intrinsic flux of human action, to channel it towards certain ends by generalizing and institutionalizing particular cognitive representations. Secondly, organization is a pattem that is constituted, shaped, and emerging from change. Organization aims at stemming change but, in the process of doing so, it is generated by it. These claims are illustrated by drawing on the work of several organizational ethnographers. The implications of this view for theory and practice are outlined.},

This raises the question how organizations can design work contexts that contribute to sustainable employment. This study investigated the role of a intrinsically motivating job (intrinsic job value) and an age-supportive climate for three indicators of employees’ sustainable employment: employability, work engagement and affective commitment. The questionnaire was completed by 119 office employees (response 35\%) of a Dutch public transport organization. A SEM analysis revealed that intrinsic job value was strongly and positively related with all three indicators of sustainable employment for employees of all ages. In contrast, an age-supportive climate was especially important for older employees’ work engagement and affective commitment. This study has implications for practice and for research of sustainable employment, HRM and aging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Contrary to affective organizational commitment, affective commitment to customers enhanced service quality. The 2 subdimensions of continuance commitment to the organization—perceived high sacrifice and perceived lack of alternatives— exerted effects opposite in sign: The former fostered service quality, whereas the latter reduced it.

Results of confirmatory factor analyses supported the differentiation between the three categories of job characteristics in two samples (N 1 = 261 and N 2 = 441). Further, structural equation modelling confirmed the hypotheses that job hindrances associate positively with exhaustion (i.e., the main component of burnout) and negatively with vigour (i.e., the main component of work engagement). Job resources displayed the reversed pattern of relations. Job challenges were positively related to vigour. Rather unexpectedly, they were unrelated to exhaustion. Based on these findings, we discuss the importance of the differentiation between different types of job demands in the JD-R model for both theory and practice.},

A synthesis of the cross-cultural competence, organizational intelligence, and multilevel analysis literatures was used to construct a theoretical basis for organizational cross-cultural competence and the development of quantitative measures of the construct. Based on this synthesis, three strategies were identified for assessing cross-cultural competence at the organizational level of analysis. Three studies were conducted to test these three strategies, each of which was supported empirically through the successful generation of interpretable organization-level scales and subscales. In a fourth study, each of the organization-level measures developed in Studies 1, 2, and 3 was found to be related to organization-level indices of organizational climate, perceived organization effectiveness, and cohesion.},

Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual paper suggests several benefits that a sensemaking approach may have in enhancing organizational success in general and the effectiveness of communicating change in particular. Findings – It is suggested that the negative effects of a myopic view on information provision during change distracts from the importance of other communication activities. The fact that changes often fail to meet the expected goals can be partly attributed to the misbalance between information and communication. For practical purposes, it is suggested to stress the importance of energy in organizations and work meaning. Future research could benefit from a focus on framing. Three topics that relate to framing, i.e. conflicts, informal communication, and storytelling are suggested. Practical implications – Suggestions for practice how to organize communication during organizational change and which topics to address are offered. Originality/value – Several insights that emerge from new lines of thought in literature on organizational behaviour, organizational communication and change are used in this paper to give practical advise to change agents, and suggest directions for future research.},

Previous research showed that starters in a high strain job are indeed less satisfied. They are also not compensated for the high workload they face. This article raises the question whether this strain (‘high strain job’) is only temporary. The results of the duration analysis show that those starting in a high strain job leave their job significantly sooner than those in an ‘active’ job. For many young workers, having a high strain job as the first job seems to be temporary. However, for a substantial segment of the young workforce, there is a considerable probability of remaining in high strain jobs. This finding determines the policy implication: the discussion on work stress should focus on those trapped in high strain jobs.},

The present study examines 2 mechanisms that might explain this age difference: (a) stress appraisals of challenge and hindrance and (b) rumination. Using a weekly diary study design over 5 weeks, 280 employees across the life span (aged between 18 and 66 years), completed 1,288 weekly surveys. Work outcomes examined were job satisfaction, job engagement, affective organizational commitment, workplace well-being, and intentions to quit. Results showed that while both older and younger employees experienced age-based stereotype threat, it was uniquely problematic for older employees. Furthermore, challenge appraisals mediated the relationships between age-based stereotype threat and job engagement, commitment, and intentions to quit among older, but not younger, employees. Rumination mediated the relationships between age-based stereotype threat and job satisfaction, commitment, well-being, and intentions to quit among older, but not younger, employees. These findings suggest that stereotype threat might be detrimental to work outcomes because older employees are less likely to appraise stereotype threat as a challenge, and more likely to ruminate when they experience stereotype threat.

The in-company training program provided employees with better preparedness to manage their own careers. The program activities were universally implemented using an organization-level, 2-trainer model with trainers from the human resources management and occupational health services. The study was a within-organizations, randomly assigned field experimental study; it investigated the impacts of the intervention on immediate career management preparedness and later mental health and intentions to retire early. A total of 718 eligible individuals returned a questionnaire in 17 organizations and became voluntary participants. The respondents were randomly assigned to either an intervention (N = 369) or a comparison group (N = 349). Those in the intervention group were invited to group intervention workshops, whereas those in the comparison group received printed information about career and health-related issues. The 7-month follow-up results showed that the program significantly decreased depressive symptoms and intentions to retire early and increased mental resources among the group participants compared to the others. The mediation analyses demonstrated that the increase in career management preparedness as a proximal impact of the intervention mediated the longer term mental health effects. Those who benefited most from the intervention as regards their mental health were employees with elevated levels of depression or exhaustion and younger employees, implying additional benefits of a more targeted use of the intervention. The results demonstrated the benefits of the enhancement of individual-level career management and resilience resources as career and health promotion practice in work organizations.

  abstract = {Although transformational leadership has been studied extensively, the magnitude of the relationship between transformational leadership and follower performance across criterion types and levels of analysis remains unclear. Based on 117 independent samples over 113 primary studies, the current meta-analytic study showed that transformational leadership was positively related to individual-level follower performance across criterion types, with a stronger relationship for contextual performance than for task performance across most study settings. In addition, transformational leadership was positively related to performance at the team and organization levels. Moreover, both meta-analytic regression and relative importance analyses consistently showed that transformational leadership had an augmentation effect over transactional leadership (contingent reward) in predicting individual-level contextual performance and team-level performance. Contrary to our expectation, however, no augmentation effect of transformational leadership over contingent reward was found in predicting individual-level task performance. Instead, contingent reward explained incremental variance in individual-level task performance beyond that explained by transformational leadership.},

As such, researchers often control for follower characteristics (e.g., age, gender, organizational tenure) when examining relations between leadership behaviors and other variables. However, reversing-the-lens theory suggests that followers’ characteristics represent substantive factors that may affect how they perceive their leaders or how leaders behave toward different followers. We conducted two studies to investigate this possibility. In Study 1, we meta-analyzed data from 479 primary studies (N = 172,494) and found meaningful relations between follower individual differences (e.g., gender, personality) and ratings of their leaders’ behaviors (e.g., transformational leadership, abusive supervision). In Study 2, we conducted a primary study to estimate the extent to which actual leader behaviors or differences in follower perceptions of those behaviors account for these relations. Results suggest that follower perceptions and measurement error explain almost the same or more variance in follower ratings than do actual leader behaviors. In addition, other findings imply that relations between some follower characteristics (e.g., gender, neuroticism) and leadership ratings are likely to be due to perceptual differences associated with these follower characteristics. However, actual leader behaviors also appear to play a role, such that leaders tend to behave differently toward followers who possess high or low levels of certain characteristics (e.g., agreeableness). Taken together, this two-study investigation provides evidence that follower individual differences are related to ratings of leader behaviors and, thus, deserve more attention within leadership theory and research.

Those differences suggest the need to refine traditional assumptions that poor person–job fit causes lower well-being. More activated forms of well-being were proposed to be associated with poorer, rather than better, want–actual fit, since greater motivation raises wanted levels of job features and may thus reduce fit with actual levels. As predicted, activated well-being (illustrated by job engagement) and more quiescent well-being (here, job satisfaction) were found to be associated with poor fit in opposite directions—positively and negatively, respectively. Theories and organizational practices need to accommodate the partly contrasting implications of different forms of well-being. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

As expected, all groups with specific and difficult group goals performed better than DYB control groups. It is hypothesized that these positive effects of group goal setting on brainstorming performance arise because group goal setting counteracts motivation losses such as social loafing. In addition, group goal setting should promote motivation gains arising from social compensation and related cognitive processes, in particular high identification with the group. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was found that group goal setting increased team identification, the readiness to compensate for other weak group members, the value of group success, and the value of group failure. Mediation analysis also indicated that concern to avoid group failure was partly responsible for performance improvements. Finally, no large differences were found between PGGS + IGS and PGGS or DGGS. On this basis group goal setting can be considered a robust strategy for improving work motivation and brainstorming performance in groups.},

This paper seeks to answer this question in two steps. First, we briefly summarize the main findings from 26 meta-analyses concerned with traditional practices such as goal setting, feedback, work design, financial incentives, or training. These practices can improve both organizational performance and the well-being of organizational members. Second, we examine in more depth a new, increasingly important high performance work practice: Employee involvement in organizational leadership (EIOL). This approach is built on theories focusing on organizational participation, shared leadership, and organizational democracy. We also illustrate recently constructed measurement instruments for assessing these constructs. This synopsis leads us to the development of a new integrative, multilevel model of EIOL. The model includes several mediator (e.g., knowledge exchange) and moderator variables (e.g., self-leadership competencies of actors) that explain why and when this approach is effective. We conclude that future research should focus on cross-level interactions of different forms of organizational participation, shared leadership, and organizational democracy, and seek to identify the processes mediating their interplay.

  abstract = {The construct of flow has been associated with a plethora of positive work outcomes such as performance, engagement, and reduced burnout. However, flow is understudied in the domain of work and there is a lack of empirical examinations of flow interventions. Additionally, until recently, the vast majority of research examining flow at work assumes that individuals are passive agents who only experience flow when their working conditions facilitate the state. Therefore, the study tested a 'SMART' goal‐setting nudge intervention for individuals, aimed at increasing flow at work and its positive outcomes. Results of a 5‐day experimental experience sampling study with 65 American MTurk workers (who work full‐time besides MTurk) indicate that those in the goal‐setting condition experienced more flow at work and subsequently experienced less daily stress, as well as higher engagement and subjective performance when compared to the control group. Exploratory analyses revealed that flow decreased later in the week within‐day for participants in the control group, whereas flow remained relatively stable within‐day for those in the goal‐setting condition. Moreover, certain categories of goals, such as mastery goals, resource acquisition goals, and understanding goals, were found to be significant predictors of daily flow. Practitioner points: Flow at work predicted daily stress, daily performance, and work engagement.Self‐determination strategies (Occupat Health Sci, 1, 2017, 47), such as goal setting, can increase the amount of flow experienced at work and its subsequent positive outcomes.Nudges (Nudge: Improving decisions about health, wealth, and happiness, Yale University Press, 2008) can provide reminders for individuals to engage in behaviors that help them to experience flow and its positive work outcomes.A proposed model was supported as a framework practitioners can use to better understand flow at work along with its antecedents and outcomes.},

We used job demands-resources theory in order to derive our hypotheses at the intra- and inter-individual level. Method: Multi-level analyses in a sample of 235 followers in 71 teams confirmed some of our hypotheses. Results: We demonstrate that vulnerable narcissism is positively related to followers’ emotional exhaustion and negatively related to work engagement. Moreover, leaders’ grandiose narcissism exacerbates the negative relationship between followers’ vulnerable narcissism and their work engagement. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the various facets of narcissism play an important role in an organizational context and suggest that vulnerable narcissism in particular, which has been largely neglected in previous research, is an important determinant of work-related well-being. Further, we form a holistic understanding of the leadership process by emphasizing the interaction between leaders’ and followers’ personalities, adding to the leadership literature by integrating leader and follower characteristics.},

Results indicated that the tools significantly differentiated between high and low performers, and there was a significant correlation between test performance and individual sales output.

Hypotheses were tested among 714 Dutch employees. Results showed that personal resources did not offset the relationship between job demands and exhaustion. Instead, personal resources mediated the relationship between job resources and engagement/exhaustion and influenced the perception of job resources.

  abstract = {Purpose – Organizations aspire to have engaged employees, and spend considerable resources to measure and improve employee engagement. Theoretically, leadership is a key antecedent of engagement, yet there is no research directly linking leader behaviors and follower engagement. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the evidence for such a link. Design/methodology/approach – Research was conducted with a large New Zealand insurance organization, using data from direct reports. A pilot study was first conducted (n=236), in which the JRA 360‐degree feedback instrument was factor analyzed. Subsequently, a linkage analysis (n=178) was conducted to establish the relationship of the resultant leadership factors with JRA's employee engagement measure. Findings – Three factors emerged from the JRA 360: supports team, performs effectively, and displays integrity. Correlation and regression results showed that supports team was the strongest predictor of engagement; semi‐partial correlations showed that the three leadership factors overlapped in their relationships with engagement, with supports team predicting most unique variance. Research limitations/ implications – Additional research is needed to assess the generalizability of the findings, and to establish causality. Practical implications – The results demonstrate that there are multiple ways in which leadership behaviors are associated with employee engagement. The primacy of supports team suggests that leader behaviors in this domain should be a priority. Although our design does not establish causality, we suggest that leaders should capitalize on their strengths to improve engagement among their followers. Originality/value – The design of this study is superior to previous research, in particular using a clear measure of employee engagement. The results suggest that team‐oriented behaviors are the most important for leaders in achieving high employee engagement. Importantly, the results also indicate that other leadership behaviors – relating to effective performance and displaying integrity – may also facilitate employee engagement.},

Cross-sectional data from a multiworksite (U.S.-based) sample of 2,195 workers aged 18 to 81 years were used to estimate ordinary least squares regression models. After accounting for a variety of factors that could influence engagement levels (i.e., demographics, health status, and job or personal resources), findings indicated that employees with similar-age supervisors were less engaged than employees with older supervisors. Moreover, while employees who did not know the ages of their supervisors were just as engaged as employees with older supervisors. Implications for engaging an age-diverse workforce are discussed.},

In keeping with the ethos of much qualitative research, some open-ended, flexible principles are suggested as a guide to the quality of a qualitative study: sensitivity to context; commitment and rigour; transparency and coherence; impact and importance. Examples are given of the very different ways in which various forms of qualitative research can meet these criteria.},

  abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to explore the relationship between internal communication and organizational learning from an interpretive perspective. Design/methodology/approach – Following a review of the internal communication and organizational learning literature, an exploratory phenomenological methodology was designed to capture the “essences” of experiences relating to “communication” and “learning” among employees within a UK healthcare organization with an aspiration of becoming a “learning organization.” Transcripts of interviews were analyzed, coded thematically and the essences of experiences collectively synthesized into one description. Findings – The paper concludes that internal communication may contribute to the development of organizational learning through sense‐making processes. For the participants in this study, these processes were personal letters and memos, line management interactions and interactions with other colleagues. “Learning” was associated with the acquisition of knowledge through day‐to‐day interactions, self‐development and studying. However, some sense‐making activities designed to engage employees in organizational change were less relevant to participants. Practical implications – The research highlights the need for internal communication strategies that match meanings to context, based upon research that recognises the social and culturally diverse nature of organizations; the interactions and identities of occupational groups; and how these groups in turn construct and reproduce their social world through discursive practices. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates the relevance of interpretive approaches to corporate communication research that gives prominence to the everyday, subjective experiences, perceptions and feelings of organizational members.},

A growing body of journalistic accounts raised the possibility that the lockdown caused by the pandemic has affected women and men in different ways, due mostly to the traditionally gendered division of labour in society. We attempt to test this oft-cited argument by conducting an original survey with nearly 200 academics. Specifically, we explore the extent to which the effect of the lockdown on childcare, housework and home-office environment varies across women and men. Our results show that a number of factors are associated with the effect of the lockdown on the work conditions of academics at home, including gender, having children, perceived threat from COVID-19 and satisfaction with the work environment. We also show that having children disproportionately affects women in terms of the amount of housework during the lockdown.},
