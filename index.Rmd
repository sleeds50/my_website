__Welcome to my website!__

# {.tabset}

## <u>Introduction</u>

### Thanks for stopping by!


The title of this site incorporates my interests in qualified areas of psychology (Social + Occupational), along with additional interest in R-programming (with RStudio, of course).

My intention for creating this website was to promote a personal; and professional, 
on-line presence to keep things in one accessible place.

## <u>Employment</u>

### Now
After acheiving my BSc (Honours) Social Psychology in 2020, I decided to educate myself further (mainly due to the Covid19 pandemic!), by studying a full-time MSc Occupational Psychology, in the hope after completion, of finding a more suitable role for my interests and needs. Ideally, I am looking for assistant researcher; assistant Occupational Psychologist positions or Social Psychology roles. I'm willing to combine both areas of interest, obviously; and have a keen interest in R-programming, to accompany SPSS and JASP skills. I also have a working knowledge of Nvivo and RQDA for qualitative analysis.

### Then
Before I decided to concentrate wholly on my (then) undergraduate degree in 2018, I had been in full-time employment since leaving secondary education. Various short-lived jobs filled the gap before I undertook an electrical apprenticeship in 1989; and I continued working in several electrical disciplines for 29 years. These included; and are not limited to: maintenance of university estate; technical drawing; inspection & testing; installation and maintenance of sewage treatment plants; and finally, maintenance of utility scale solar sites (LV/HV; AC/DC supplies) in the UK. Each job allowed me to train; and transfer new skills and abilities; honing my focus, dedication, and commitment.
