### Thanks for stopping by!

The title of this site incorporates my interests in qualified areas of
psychology (Social + Occupational), with additional interest in R-programming
with RStudio.

My intention for creating this website^[<small><u>Note</u>: This website is a
collection of regular *RMarkdown* documents, so you can use all the usual
formatting. If you are new to R Markdown, you can learn more about it [on the R
Markdown website</small>](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).] ^[<small><u>Credit</u>: Thanks to
*Andreas Handel* for this [build
tutorial</small>](https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/github-website/).] was to promote
a personal, professional on-line presence to keep things in one accessible
place.
