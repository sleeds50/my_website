## <u>Introduction</u>

### Thanks for stopping by!

The title of this site incorporates my interests in qualified areas of
psychology (Social + Occupational), along with additional interest in
R-programming (with RStudio, of course).

My intention for creating this website was to promote a personal; and
professional, on-line presence to keep things in one accessible place.

## <u>Employment</u>

### Now

After achieving my BSc (Honours) Social Psychology (grade 2.1) in 2020, I
decided to educate myself further by studying a full-time MSc in Occupational
Psychology, in the hope of finding a more suitable role for my interests and
needs. Ideally, I am looking for assistant researcher; assistant Occupational
Psychologist positions or Social Psychology roles. I'm willing to combine both
areas of interest; and have a keen interest in R-programming, to accompany SPSS
and JASP skills. I also have a working knowledge of Nvivo and RQDA for
qualitative analysis.

  - Additional transferable skills include: dedication, honesty, fortitude,
    attention to detail, data analysis, report writing, use of the usual
    MS-Office packages.

### Then

Before I decided to concentrate full-time on my (then) undergraduate degree
in 2018, I had been in full-time employment since leaving secondary education.
Various short-lived jobs filled the gap before I undertook an electrical
apprenticeship in 1989; and I continued working in several electrical
disciplines for 29 years. These included; and are not limited to: maintenance of
university estate; technical drawing; inspection & testing; installation and
maintenance of sewage treatment plants; and finally, maintenance of utility
scale solar sites (LV/HV; AC/DC supplies) in the UK. Each job allowed me to
train; and transfer new skills and abilities; honing my focus, dedication, and
commitment.
