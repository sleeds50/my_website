>It occurred to me that I have lived in many places during my lifetime. This is a basic run-down of them all, giving rough locations as coordinates. I might return to it at 
some point and add dates, but this will do for now.

# 1. Locations

Table 1 lists the places I have lived. Let me state that it only includes places where I 
have lived with parents as a child and young adult (see items 1:8); and places that I have 
officially rented or mortgaged as an adult (items 9:end). Furthermore, if memory serves, 
we lived in two properties in Kuwait, two in Bahrain; and I lived in Chertsey more than once; 
and rented twice in Addlestone.

I have not included sofa-surfing or temporary dwellings. 

Table 1 also shows the order of 
properties lived in, from birth to now (some 50-ish years later!)

# 3a. Static plots

## Global view of places lived

```{r map worldwide plot}

# all locations
ggplot(dwellings, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  geom_point(
    pch = 19,
    colour = dwellings$List,
    size = 2
  ) +
  coord_map(projection = "globular") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.0076589) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.4825766) +
  labs(
    title = "Coordinate plot 1: Worldwide locations",
    caption = "Note. Coordinates intercept at Greenwich, London"
  ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))
```

## The spread of locations in England

```{r map uk plot}

# all England locations
ggplot(dwellings, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  xlim(-2.5, 1.5) +
  ylim(51, 52.5) +
  geom_point(
    colour = dwellings$Latitude,
    size = 3
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    label = dwellings$List
  ) +
  coord_map(projection = "globular") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.0076589) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.4825766) +
  labs(
    title = "Coodinate plot 2: England",
    caption = "Note. Coordinates intercept at Greenwich, London."
  ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))
```

You can see that most of the places lived in England have been between $51^{\circ}$ and 
$52^{\circ}$ latitude, with a brief sojourn above the $52nd$ parallel (although I spent around five years living in Ipswich (16)); and between $-2.5^{\circ}$ and $1.5^{\circ}$ longitude (quite a small area, considering). 

* The numbers represent the order in which the places were lived and coincide with Table 1 above.

It is interesting that, although numerous; and despite the huge leap between locations 2 and
5 (3 and 4 abroad, see main map above), the places lived are in relatively tight clusters
suggesting that I've enjoyed a local familiarity for a while before needing/having to move on.

The clusters are divided across counties, as follows. 


# 3b. Breaking down into counties: 

## Essex and Suffolk

```{r map Essex plot}

# Essex and Suffolk
ggplot(dwellings, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  xlim(-0.1, 1.3) +
  ylim(51.4, 52.2) +
  geom_point(
    colour = dwellings$List,
    size = 3
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    label = dwellings$List
  ) +
  coord_map(projection = "globular") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.0076589) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.4825766) +
  labs(
    title = "Coodinate plot 3: Essex and Suffolk",
    caption = "Note. Coordinates intercept at Greenwich, London"
  ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))
```

## Surrey and Middlesex

```{r map Surrey/middx plot}

# Surrey and Middlesex
ggplot(dwellings, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  xlim(-0.55, 0.001) +
  ylim(51.35, 51.49) +
  geom_point(
    colour = dwellings$List,
    size = 3
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    label = dwellings$List
  ) +
  coord_map(projection = "globular") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.0076589) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.4825766) +
  labs(
    title = "Coodinate plot 4: Surrey/Middlesex",
    caption = "Note. Coordinates intercept at Greenwich, London"
  ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))
```

## Somerset

There's little point presenting a plot with two points on it, so Coordinate plot 5 below 
shows the locations in Surrey/Middlesex and Somerset and the expanse between.

```{r map Bath plot}

# Somerset
ggplot(dwellings, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  xlim(-2.4, 0.01) +
  ylim(51.3, 51.5) +
  geom_point(
    colour = dwellings$List,
    size = 3
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    label = dwellings$List
  ) +
  coord_map(projection = "globular") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.0076589) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.4825766) +
  labs(
    title = "Coodinate plot 5: London to Somerset",
    caption = "Note. Coordinates intercept at Greenwich, London"
  ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))
```

# 3c. Mean and Median locations

## Mean coordinates

I thought it would be interesting to know the mean and median locations of where I have 
lived in the world; and in England.

Table 2 shows the mean coordinates of both the worldwide; and the England locations  from
Table 1. In my mind, these give an indication of where I should be living according to  the
mean-average coordinates of where I actually _have_ lived.

```{r mean coords table}

# mean coordinates
meanCoords |>
  kbl(caption = "<b>Table 2</b><br> <i>Average coordinates (mean)</i>") |>
  kable_classic_2(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

```{r mean coords plot}

# mean coords plot
ggplot(meanCoords, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  xlim(-1, 10) +
  ylim(49, 53) +
  geom_point(
    colour = "blue",
    size = 5
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    label = meanCoords$Place,
    nudge_x = 3, nudge_y = 0.5
  ) +
  coord_map(projection = "globular") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.0076589) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.4825766) +
  labs(
    title = "Coodinate plot 6: the average (mean) of all coordinates",
    caption = "Note. Coordinates intercept at Greenwich, London
            Cheshunt= England dwelling mean
            GÃ©nicourt-sur-Meuse= World dwelling mean"
  ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))
```


I must admit, I quite fancy __GÃ©nicourt-sur-Meuse, France__. I've never been there, but it
sounds like it would suit me. Ironically, I worked in Cheshunt for a fair while until I was
made redundant, though I didn't miss the daily journey from Harwich and back which became
a drag after about 5 years of working for the company there.


## Median coordinates

Table 3 shows the median coordinates of both the worldwide; and the England locations from
Table 1. 

So, technically, these will be the absolute mid-point places to live according to both
options.

```{r median coords table}

# median coordinates
medianCoords |>
  kbl(caption = "<b>Table 3</b><br> <i> Average coordinates (median)</i>") |>
  kable_classic_2(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

```{r med coords plot}

# median coordinates plot
ggplot(medianCoords, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  xlim(-1, 2.5) +
  ylim(51, 52) +
  geom_point(
    colour = "red",
    size = 5
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    label = medianCoords$Place, 
    nudge_x = 1, nudge_y = 0.1
  ) +
  coord_map(projection = "globular") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.0076589) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.4825766) +
  geom_point(x = 0.176, y = 51.5655, pch = 8, size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Coodinate plot 7: the average (median) of all coordinates",
    caption = "Note. Coordinates intercept at Greenwich, London
            * = Rush Green, Dagenham
            Stapleford Abbotts= England dwelling median
            Upminster= World dwelling median"
  ) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"))
```


<br>

>_Note._ The irony of the median coordinate plot is that both locations from the worldwide 
and England coordinates are a stones throw from where I was born! (Shown with an asterisk on
the map above).

<br>

## Distances from the median locations to where I was born

So for fun, we'll use the `distm` function from the `geosphere` package to calculate the 
distances between coordinates in metres (tutorial found on [Statistics Globe](https://statisticsglobe.com/geospatial-distance-between-two-points-in-r) - actually a
good site and recommended for many explanations of R-functions).

Once installed and loaded, I realised I needed another variable to hold the _Rush Green _ 
coordinates. Then, I found out that `distm` needs the longitude and latitude in that order, 
so had to reverse the two columns in my original mean/median variables, then combined the
two new variables into one, for each.

So the calculation returns like this for Stapleford Abbot: 


```{r distance between- setup}

# install.packages("geosphere") for calculating distance between coordinates

# load additional "geosphere" library
library(geosphere) 

# create rush_green coordinate variable
rush_green <- c(Longitude = 0.176, 
                Latitude = 51.5655, 
                Place = "Dagenham, Essex, England") 

# create new median coords variable and swap long. and lat. variables because that's 
# how `distm` likes it
median_coord_swap <- medianCoords |> 
  relocate(Longitude, .before = Latitude)

#  and combine row 2 with rush_to_stapleford variable
rush_to_stapleford <- median_coord_swap[2,] |> 
  rbind(rush_green)

# calculate distance between median places (Apply distm function)
dist_median <- distm(rush_to_stapleford[, 1:2], fun = distGeo)

# Print distance matrix
dist_median
```
...and this for Upminster...

```{r distance between- calc}

# new rush_to_upminster variable combined with row 1 of median swap variable
rush_to_upminster <- median_coord_swap[1,] |> 
  rbind(rush_green)

# calculate mean distance
dist_mean <- distm(rush_to_upminster[, 1:2], fun = distGeo)

# print matrix
dist_mean

```

## Summary

Remember the distances are in metres - I used [this website](https://www.convertunits.com/from/meters/to/miles) (others are 
available!) to convert the distances into miles (not sure if the site specifies US miles as others have done, or my preferred UK miles, however...)

>It's enough to give a guide to how close _Rush Green_ is...

> to the median location of places in England:  
* Stapleford Abbotts = 8.73Km (5.43 miles) away.

>to the median point of the worldwide locations:  
* Upminster = 5.58Km (3.47 miles) away.

This has been an interesting project - thanks for reading. I might take it further one day 
and tell the story of each place and why I moved so many times. I'm sure that the average 
moves during a lifetime is far fewer than what I have achieved here. Does it mean I haven't 
settled anywhere? Or is it acting on circumstances? A mixture of both? Why have I laid my hat 
in; and called so many different locations, home? 

(Social) psychology would describe these transitional moments of upheaval as _ruptures_ 
[(Zittoun, 2006, p. 5)](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Transitions/ivgnDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PR1&printsec=frontcover), 
since they can cause stress and disruption to 'normal' life (whatever _that_ is). Maybe that 
explains a few things!
