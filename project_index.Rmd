1.  [**Itâ€™s never too late to learn new things**](./apwo.html)

*One of the modules for my MSc was Applying Psychology to Work & Organisations
(APWO). A requirement was to write a short blog-post about the experience. Given
that the work was undertaken during the Covid19 pandemic, suffice to say it was
conducted remotely.*

2.  [**Final dissertation summary**](./dissertation_summary.html)

*A summary of my final dissertation. It was not ground-breaking, neither will it
be published nor presented at any Occupational Psychology conference. However, I
am proud that it was my highest scoring assignment which earned me a full MSc
degree with Merit.*
