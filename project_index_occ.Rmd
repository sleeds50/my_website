conducted remotely.* [Reading time: 3 minutes]

2.  [**Engagement at work**](./dissertation_summary.html)

be published nor presented at any Occupational Psychology conference. However, I
am proud that it was my highest scoring assignment which earned me a full MSc
degree with Merit.* [Reading time: 4 minutes]
